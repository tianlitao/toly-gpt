This code is the main entry point for the CKB executable. It imports the `run_app` function from the `ckb_bin` module and the `Version` struct from the `ckb_build_info` module. It also defines a global allocator using the `tikv_jemallocator` crate.

The `main` function first calls `get_version` to retrieve the version information for the CKB executable. It then passes this version information to the `run_app` function. If `run_app` returns an error, the program exits with the exit code from the error.

The `get_version` function retrieves the version information from environment variables set during the build process. It parses the major, minor, and patch version numbers from the `CARGO_PKG_VERSION_*` variables. It also retrieves the pre-release version string from the `CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PRE` variable and appends a dash if the string is not empty. It then constructs a `Version` struct with this information, along with the commit description and date if available.

This code is important for providing version information to the CKB executable, which can be useful for debugging and tracking changes between releases. It also demonstrates the use of environment variables to retrieve build information, which can be useful in other parts of the project. For example, other modules may use environment variables to retrieve configuration information or to conditionally compile code based on the build environment.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `run_app` function and where is it defined?
- The `run_app` function is used to run the ckb application and it is defined in the `ckb_bin` module.
2. What is the purpose of the `get_version` function and how is it used in the `main` function?
- The `get_version` function is used to retrieve the version of the ckb application and it is called in the `main` function to pass the version to the `run_app` function.
3. What is the purpose of the `ALLOC` static variable and what is its type?
- The `ALLOC` static variable is a global allocator of type `tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc` and it is used to allocate memory for the ckb application.
