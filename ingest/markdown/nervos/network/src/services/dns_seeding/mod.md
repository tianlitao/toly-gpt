The `DnsSeedingService` module is responsible for seeding the network with peer addresses obtained from DNS TXT records. The module is designed to be used as part of the larger `ckb` project, which is a cryptocurrency implementation based on the Nervos CKB blockchain.

The `DnsSeedingService` struct contains a reference to the `NetworkState` struct, which is used to manage the state of the network. It also contains a `check_interval` field, which is an instance of the `tokio::time::Interval` struct. This field is used to control the frequency at which the DNS seeding process is performed. Finally, the `seeds` field is a vector of strings that contains the DNS seed nodes to query for TXT records.

The `new` method is used to create a new instance of the `DnsSeedingService` struct. It takes a reference to the `NetworkState` struct and a vector of seed nodes as arguments. It returns a new instance of the `DnsSeedingService` struct.

The `start` method is used to start the DNS seeding process. It is an asynchronous method that runs in an infinite loop. It uses the `check_interval` field to control the frequency at which the DNS seeding process is performed. If an error occurs during the seeding process, it is logged using the `error` macro from the `ckb_logger` crate.

The `seeding` method is the heart of the DNS seeding process. It first checks if the `TXT_VERIFY_PUBKEY` constant is empty. If it is, the method returns immediately. Otherwise, it checks if there are at least two outbound peers in the network. If there are, the method returns immediately. If not, it proceeds to query the DNS seed nodes for TXT records.

For each seed node, the method queries the DNS resolver for TXT records. If the query is successful, it iterates over the records and decodes them using the `SeedRecord` struct. If the decoding is successful, the method adds the address to the peer store using the `add_addr` method. If the decoding fails, the method logs an error using the `debug` macro from the `ckb_logger` crate.

In summary, the `DnsSeedingService` module is responsible for seeding the network with peer addresses obtained from DNS TXT records. It is designed to be used as part of the larger `ckb` project, which is a cryptocurrency implementation based on the Nervos CKB blockchain. The module uses the `NetworkState` struct to manage the state of the network and the `tokio` crate to perform asynchronous operations.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `DnsSeedingService` struct and how is it used?
- The `DnsSeedingService` struct is used for DNS seeding and is created with a network state and a list of seeds. It has a `start` method that runs an infinite loop and calls the `seeding` method every 10 seconds.
2. What is the significance of the `TXT_VERIFY_PUBKEY` constant and how is it used?
- The `TXT_VERIFY_PUBKEY` constant is currently empty and is used as a placeholder for a public key that may be used for verifying DNS records in the future. If it is empty, the `seeding` method returns early and does not perform DNS seeding.
3. What external crates are used in this file and what are they used for?
- The external crates used in this file are `ckb_logger`, `faster_hex`, `secp256k1`, `tokio`, and `trust_dns_resolver`. They are used for logging, hex decoding, secp256k1 public key operations, asynchronous programming, and DNS resolution, respectively.
