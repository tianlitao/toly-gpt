The `SeedRecord` struct and its associated methods provide functionality for encoding and decoding seed node records. Seed nodes are nodes that are used to bootstrap the network by providing a list of other nodes that can be connected to.

The `SeedRecord` struct contains the following fields:
- `ip`: the IP address of the seed node
- `port`: the port number of the seed node
- `peer_id`: an optional `PeerId` that identifies the node
- `valid_until`: a future UTC timestamp indicating when the record expires
- `pubkey`: the public key of the node

The `SeedRecord` struct provides the following methods:
- `check()`: checks that the seed node is reachable, the port number is valid, and the record has not expired
- `decode(record: &str)`: decodes a seed node record from a string
- `decode_with_pubkey(record: &str, pubkey: &PublicKey)`: decodes a seed node record from a string and verifies that the public key matches the one provided
- `address()`: returns a `Multiaddr` that represents the address of the seed node
- `data_to_sign(ip: IpAddr, port: u16, peer_id: Option<&PeerId>, valid_until: u64)`: returns a string that is used to generate a signature for the seed node record

The `SeedRecord` struct is used in the larger project to manage seed node records. Seed node records are stored in a text file and are read by the node software at startup to bootstrap the network. The `SeedRecord` struct is used to decode the records and verify their authenticity. The `address()` method is used to convert the seed node record into a `Multiaddr` that can be used to connect to the node.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `SeedRecord` struct and its associated methods?
- The `SeedRecord` struct represents a record of seed nodes for a peer-to-peer network, and its associated methods are used to decode, verify, and manipulate these records.

2. What is the significance of the `lazy_static` block and the `SECP256K1` constant?
- The `lazy_static` block is used to create a global instance of the `secp256k1::Secp256k1` struct, which is used for cryptographic operations. The `SECP256K1` constant is a reference to this global instance.

3. What is the purpose of the `data_to_sign` method?
- The `data_to_sign` method is used to generate a string of data that is signed by a seed node, which is then used to verify the authenticity of the seed node's record.
