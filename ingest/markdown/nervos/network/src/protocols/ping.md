The `PingHandler` struct is a protocol handler for the ping protocol used in the ckb project. The purpose of this protocol is to periodically send ping messages to connected peers and receive pong messages in response. This allows the node to measure the round-trip time (RTT) to its peers and detect when a peer becomes unresponsive.

The `PingHandler` struct implements the `ServiceProtocol` trait from the `p2p` crate, which defines the methods that are called when the protocol is initialized, a new peer connects, a peer disconnects, a message is received, and a periodic notification is triggered. The `PingHandler` struct also defines some helper methods for sending ping and pong messages and updating the state of connected peers.

When a new peer connects, the `connected` method is called and the peer's session ID is added to the `connected_session_ids` map, along with a `PingStatus` struct that tracks the last time a ping was sent to the peer and whether a ping is currently being processed. When a ping message is received from a peer, the `received` method is called and the `ping_received` method updates the last ping time for the peer. When a pong message is received, the `received` method checks that the nonce in the pong message matches the nonce in the corresponding ping message and updates the RTT for the peer.

The `ping_peers` method is called periodically to send ping messages to connected peers. It selects a set of peers that are not currently being pinged and sends a ping message to them. The `notify` method is called periodically to check for peers that have not responded to a ping message within the timeout period and disconnect them.

The `PingMessage` struct defines the format of ping and pong messages using the `packed` types from the `ckb-types` crate. The `build_ping` and `build_pong` methods create ping and pong messages with a given nonce value. The `decode` method parses a byte slice into a `PingPayload` enum that represents either a ping or pong message.

Overall, the `PingHandler` protocol handler is an important component of the ckb node's networking stack that allows it to monitor the responsiveness of its peers and maintain a healthy peer-to-peer network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PingHandler` struct and how does it work?
- The `PingHandler` struct is a protocol handler for the ping protocol. It periodically sends ping messages to connected peers and checks for timeout if no pong message is received within a certain duration. It also handles received ping and pong messages and updates the ping status of peers accordingly.

2. What is the significance of the `nonce` field in the `PingStatus` and `PingMessage` structs?
- The `nonce` field is a meaningless value that is used to match a received pong message with the corresponding ping message. When a ping message is sent, it includes a nonce value that is stored in the `PingStatus` of the corresponding peer. When a pong message is received, it includes the same nonce value, which is used to identify the corresponding ping message.

3. How does the `PingHandler` struct interact with the `NetworkState` struct?
- The `PingHandler` struct interacts with the `NetworkState` struct by updating the ping status of peers in the peer registry. When a ping or pong message is received, the corresponding peer's `last_ping_protocol_message_received_at` and `ping_rtt` fields are updated. When a new ping protocol is opened or closed, the corresponding peer's `protocols` field is updated.
