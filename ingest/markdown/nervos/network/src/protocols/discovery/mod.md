The `DiscoveryProtocol` module is responsible for discovering new nodes in the network and sharing known nodes with other peers. It implements the `ServiceProtocol` trait, which defines the behavior of a protocol that can be used as a service in the CKB network.

The module defines a `DiscoveryProtocol` struct that contains a list of sessions, an optional announce check interval, and an address manager. The `AddressManager` trait is implemented by the `DiscoveryAddressManager` struct, which is responsible for managing the addresses of the nodes discovered by the protocol.

The `DiscoveryProtocol` struct implements the `ServiceProtocol` trait, which defines the behavior of the protocol. The `init` method initializes the protocol and sets a service notify to check for new nodes periodically. The `connected` method is called when a new session is established, and it registers the session with the address manager. The `disconnected` method is called when a session is terminated, and it removes the session from the list of sessions and unregisters it from the address manager. The `received` method is called when a message is received from a peer, and it processes the message according to its type. The `notify` method is called periodically to check for new nodes to announce to other peers.

The module also defines several constants that are used by the protocol, such as the maximum number of new addresses to accumulate before announcing, the maximum number of addresses in one `Nodes` item, and the interval at which to send an announce nodes message.

Overall, the `DiscoveryProtocol` module is an important part of the CKB network that enables nodes to discover and share information about other nodes in the network. It is used by other modules in the project to establish and maintain connections with other peers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DiscoveryProtocol` and how does it work?
- The `DiscoveryProtocol` is responsible for discovering and sharing network addresses with other peers in the network. It sends and receives messages containing lists of network addresses and manages a list of known addresses for each peer. It also periodically sends "announce nodes" messages to other peers to share its own address.

2. What are the different types of messages that the `DiscoveryProtocol` can send and receive?
- The `DiscoveryProtocol` can send and receive two types of messages: `GetNodes` and `Nodes`. `GetNodes` requests a list of network addresses from the receiving peer, while `Nodes` contains a list of network addresses to be shared with the receiving peer.

3. How does the `DiscoveryAddressManager` determine whether a network address is valid or not?
- The `DiscoveryAddressManager` determines whether a network address is valid by checking whether it is a local or invalid address. If `discovery_local_address` is set to `false`, it checks whether the address is reachable. Otherwise, it considers all addresses to be valid.
