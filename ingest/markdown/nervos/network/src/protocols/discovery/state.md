This code defines the `SessionState` struct and its associated methods. The `SessionState` struct is used to maintain the state of a session between two nodes in the CKB network.

The `SessionState` struct has several fields, including `addr_known`, which is used to keep track of known addresses of other nodes in the network, `remote_addr`, which is the address of the remote node, and `announce_multiaddrs`, which is a list of addresses that the local node wants to announce to the remote node.

The `SessionState` struct has several methods, including `new`, which creates a new `SessionState` object, `check_timer`, which checks if it is time to send an announcement message to the remote node, and `send_messages`, which sends any pending announcement messages to the remote node.

The `SessionState` struct is used by other parts of the CKB network code to manage the state of network sessions. For example, the `p2p::Session` struct, which represents a session between two nodes in the network, has a `state` field that is an instance of `SessionState`.

Here is an example of how the `SessionState` struct might be used in the larger CKB network codebase:

```rust
use ckb_network::p2p::Session;
use ckb_network::NetworkConfig;
use ckb_sync::NetworkProtocol;

let config = NetworkConfig::default();
let session = Session::new(config.network_type, NetworkProtocol::Discovery, Some("127.0.0.1:8115".parse().unwrap()));
let state = session.state;
let addr_manager = ...; // create an instance of an address manager
let session_state = SessionState::new(&state, &addr_manager).await;
```

In this example, a new `Session` object is created, and its `state` field is used to create a new `SessionState` object. The `addr_manager` object is an instance of an address manager, which is used to manage known addresses of other nodes in the network. The `SessionState` object is created using the `new` method, which takes a reference to the `SessionState` object and a reference to the `addr_manager` object.

Overall, the `SessionState` struct and its associated methods are an important part of the CKB network codebase, as they are used to manage the state of network sessions and to maintain information about known addresses of other nodes in the network.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of the session state for the discovery protocol in the ckb project.

2. What is the significance of the `REUSE_PORT_VERSION` constant?
- The `REUSE_PORT_VERSION` constant is used to enable the reuse port feature in the discovery protocol on Linux systems.

3. What is the purpose of the `RemoteAddress` enum and its methods?
- The `RemoteAddress` enum represents the remote address of a session, and its methods are used to manipulate and update the address. For example, the `change_to_listen` method changes the address from an outbound init remote address to an inbound listen address.
