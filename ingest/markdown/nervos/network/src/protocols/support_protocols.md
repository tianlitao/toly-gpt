This code defines an enum called `SupportProtocols` that lists all the protocols supported by the CKB (Nervos Network) blockchain network. The enum contains variants for each protocol, such as `Ping`, `Discovery`, `Identify`, `Sync`, `RelayV2`, etc. Each variant has associated functions that return the protocol ID, name, supported versions, and maximum message length.

The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and extensible way to manage the various protocols used by the CKB network. By defining each protocol as a variant of the `SupportProtocols` enum, the code can easily add or remove protocols as needed. The `SupportProtocols` enum also provides a way to get the protocol ID, name, and other information for each protocol, which is useful for building and handling network messages.

The code also defines a `build_meta_with_service_handle` function that takes a closure that returns a `ProtocolHandle` and returns a `ProtocolMeta` object. This function is a helper function that simplifies the process of building a `ProtocolMeta` object for a given protocol. The `ProtocolMeta` object is used by the `p2p` crate to manage the protocol's network communication.

Overall, this code provides a high-level interface for managing the various protocols used by the CKB network. It abstracts away the details of building and handling network messages, making it easier to add or remove protocols as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SupportProtocols` enum?
- The `SupportProtocols` enum lists all the supported protocols for the CKB network, including their names, versions, and maximum message lengths.

2. What is the significance of the `LASTEST_VERSION` constant?
- The `LASTEST_VERSION` constant is used to specify the latest version of a protocol supported by CKB. It is used in the `support_versions` method of the `SupportProtocols` enum.

3. What is the purpose of the `build_meta_with_service_handle` method?
- The `build_meta_with_service_handle` method is a helper function that builds a `ProtocolMeta` struct with a given service handle. It is used to create a `ProtocolMeta` object for each supported protocol, which is then used to register the protocol with the P2P service.
