The `Feeler` struct is a protocol implementation for the CKB (Nervos) blockchain network. It is used to establish connections with other nodes in the network and to refresh the peer store after a connection has been established.

The `Feeler` struct has a single field, `network_state`, which is an `Arc` reference to the `NetworkState` struct. The `NetworkState` struct is a shared state object that contains information about the current state of the network, including the peer registry and peer store.

The `Feeler` struct implements the `ServiceProtocol` trait, which defines the methods that must be implemented for a protocol to be used as a service in the P2P network. The `ServiceProtocol` trait is part of the `p2p` crate, which is a Rust library for building P2P networks.

The `Feeler` struct has three methods that implement the `ServiceProtocol` trait: `init()`, `connected()`, and `disconnected()`.

The `init()` method is called when the protocol is first initialized. In this implementation, it does nothing.

The `connected()` method is called when a connection is established with another node in the network. It takes a `ProtocolContextMutRef` argument, which provides access to the session information and control functions for the protocol.

If the connection is outbound, the method retrieves the flags associated with the peer from the peer registry and adds the peer's address to the peer store with the retrieved flags. The `Flags` struct is an enum that represents the capabilities of a peer, such as whether it supports the same protocol version as the local node.

After the peer has been added to the peer store, the method disconnects from the peer using the `async_disconnect_with_message()` function. This function sends a disconnect message to the peer and waits for the peer to acknowledge the message before closing the connection.

The `disconnected()` method is called when a connection is closed. It removes the peer from the peer registry and logs a message indicating that the peer has been disconnected.

Overall, the `Feeler` protocol is used to establish connections with other nodes in the network and to refresh the peer store after a connection has been established. It is part of the larger CKB blockchain network and is used to maintain the network's connectivity and integrity.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the Feeler struct and how is it used in the project?
- The Feeler struct currently does nothing and is used to auto-refresh the peer store after a connection is made with the CKBProtocol.
2. What is the significance of the Flags enum and how is it used in the code?
- The Flags enum is used to identify the type of peer connection and is used to add outbound addresses to the peer store.
3. What is the role of the async_disconnect_with_message function and when is it called?
- The async_disconnect_with_message function is used to disconnect a session with a peer and is called when there is an error during the connection process.
