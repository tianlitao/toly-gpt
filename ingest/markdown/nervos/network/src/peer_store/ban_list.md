The `BanList` module provides functionality for managing a list of banned IP addresses. It is used in the larger project to prevent certain IP addresses from connecting to the network.

The `BanList` struct contains a `HashMap` that maps `IpNetwork` to `BannedAddr`. The `insert_count` field is used to keep track of the number of times an IP address has been added to the list. When `insert_count` is a multiple of `CLEAR_INTERVAL_COUNTER`, the `clear_expires` method is called to remove any expired bans from the list.

The `ban` method adds a new `BannedAddr` to the list. The `unban_network` method removes a banned IP address from the list.

The `is_ip_banned` method checks whether an IP address is banned. It first converts the IP address to an `IpNetwork` and checks if it is in the banned list. If not, it iterates through the banned list and checks if the IP address is contained within any of the banned networks.

The `is_addr_banned` method checks whether a `Multiaddr` is banned. It first converts the `Multiaddr` to a `SocketAddr` and then checks if the IP address associated with the `SocketAddr` is banned.

The `get_banned_addrs` method returns a `Vec` of all the banned addresses.

The `count` method returns the number of banned addresses in the list.

Example usage:

```rust
use ckb::ckb_network::BanList;
use ckb::ckb_network::types::BannedAddr;
use std::net::{IpAddr, Ipv4Addr};
use std::str::FromStr;

fn main() {
    let mut ban_list = BanList::new();
    let ip_addr = IpAddr::from_str("192.168.0.1").unwrap();
    let banned_addr = BannedAddr::new(ip_addr, None);
    ban_list.ban(banned_addr);
    assert!(ban_list.is_ip_banned(&ip_addr));
    ban_list.unban_network(&ip_addr.into());
    assert!(!ban_list.is_ip_banned(&ip_addr));
}
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall ckb project?
- This code implements a ban list for IP addresses and is part of the peer store module in the ckb project, which manages peer connections and data exchange.

2. How does the ban list work and what criteria are used to determine if an IP address should be banned?
- The ban list is implemented as a HashMap of banned IP networks and their associated ban information. An IP address is considered banned if it matches a banned network or if it is banned individually with a specific ban time.

3. What methods are available for interacting with the ban list and what information can be obtained from it?
- The BanList struct provides methods for banning and unbanning IP addresses, checking if an IP or Multiaddr is banned, getting a list of banned addresses, and counting the number of banned addresses. The ban information includes the banned IP network, the ban reason, and the ban expiration time.
