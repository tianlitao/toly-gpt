The code is a bash script that checks the correctness of the `Cargo.toml` files in the `ckb` project. The `Cargo.toml` file is a configuration file for Rust projects that contains metadata about the project, its dependencies, and other configuration options. The script checks the following aspects of the `Cargo.toml` files:

1. Package name: The script checks that the package name in each `Cargo.toml` file starts with the prefix `ckb-` or is `ckb`. If the package name does not meet this requirement, an error message is printed.

2. Version: The script checks that the version number in each `Cargo.toml` file is the same as the version number in the root `Cargo.toml` file. If the version number is different, an error message is printed.

3. License: The script checks that the license in each `Cargo.toml` file is the same as the license in the root `Cargo.toml` file. If the license is different, an error message is printed.

4. Cargo publish: The script checks that each `Cargo.toml` file contains a description, homepage, and repository field. If any of these fields are missing, an error message is printed.

5. Dependencies: The script checks that the dependencies in each `Cargo.toml` file are correctly specified. It checks that each dependency is used in the code, and that the version number of each dependency is specified correctly. If a dependency is not used in the code or if the version number is not specified correctly, an error message is printed.

The script is intended to be run as part of the build process for the `ckb` project. It ensures that the `Cargo.toml` files are correctly configured, which is important for building and packaging the project. The script can be run manually by developers to check the correctness of their changes to the `Cargo.toml` files. For example, to run the script, developers can execute the following command in the root directory of the `ckb` project:

```
./script/check-cargo-toml.sh
```

If the script finds any errors, it prints an error message and exits with a non-zero status code, indicating that the build has failed. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the check has completed successfully.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
- This script checks the `Cargo.toml` files in the `ckb` project for errors related to package name, version, license, dependencies, and other metadata.

2. What external dependencies does this script require?
- This script requires `gsed` and `ggrep` to be installed on macOS. If they are not installed, the script will prompt the user to install them via Homebrew.

3. What is the output of this script?
- The script outputs any errors found in the `Cargo.toml` files, including missing or incorrect package names, versions, licenses, and dependencies. If any errors are found, the script will exit with a non-zero status code.
