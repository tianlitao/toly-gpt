This script is a Bash script that is used to run various tests and checks on the ckb project. It is designed to be run in a GitHub Actions workflow and is triggered by various events such as pull requests or pushes to the repository. The purpose of this script is to automate the testing and checking process, making it easier for developers to ensure that their code is working as expected and meets the project's standards.

The script first sets some variables and checks the available disk space. If the available space is below a certain threshold, it runs the `cargo clean` command to free up space. It then sets the `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` variable to the target directory of the project, which is used by Cargo to store build artifacts.

The script then uses a `case` statement to determine which workflow triggered the script and runs the appropriate tests and checks. For example, if the workflow is `ci_unit_test`, it runs the unit tests for the project using the `make test` command. If the workflow is `ci_linters`, it runs the `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` commands to check the formatting and style of the code.

The script also sets some environment variables based on the workflow and the operating system being used. For example, if the workflow is running on macOS, it sets the `CKB_FEATURES` variable to include `deadlock_detection`, `with_sentry`, and `portable`.

Overall, this script is an important part of the ckb project's testing and checking process. It automates many of the tasks that would otherwise need to be done manually, making it easier for developers to ensure that their code is working as expected and meets the project's standards.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
   
   This script is used to run various tests and checks for the ckb project based on the value of the `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` environment variable.

2. What is the significance of the `clean_threshold` variable?
   
   The `clean_threshold` variable is used to determine the minimum amount of available disk space required for the script to run. If the available space is less than this threshold, the script will run a `cargo clean` command to free up space.

3. What is the purpose of the `ci_cargo_deny` section?
   
   The `ci_cargo_deny` section is used to run security audits and license checks on the project using the `cargo-deny` tool.
