This code is a Windows batch script that initializes the ckb project for the mainnet blockchain. The script starts by clearing the command prompt screen and pushing the current directory path onto the directory stack. 

The `ckb init` command is then executed with the `--chain mainnet` option, which initializes the ckb project for the mainnet blockchain. This command creates a new directory called `ckb` in the current directory and sets up the necessary files and folders for the project. 

Finally, the `PAUSE` command is used to pause the script execution and wait for user input before closing the command prompt window. This allows the user to review any output or errors generated by the `ckb init` command before the window is closed. 

This script is likely used as a setup step for the ckb project, allowing developers to quickly and easily initialize the project for the mainnet blockchain. It can be run from the command prompt or as part of a larger build or deployment process. 

Example usage:
```
> cd C:\my\project\directory
> init_ckb.bat
```
This will initialize the ckb project for the mainnet blockchain in the `C:\my\project\directory\ckb` directory.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `ckb init --chain mainnet` command do?
   - This command initializes a new CKB project with the mainnet configuration.

2. What is the purpose of `PUSHD %~dp0`?
   - This command changes the current directory to the directory of the batch file being executed.

3. Why is `PAUSE` included at the end of the script?
   - This command pauses the script execution and waits for the user to press a key before closing the command prompt window. This is useful for allowing the user to review any output or errors before the window closes.
