The `reset_data` function is used to reset data for the ckb project. It takes in a `ResetDataArgs` struct as an argument, which contains various paths to directories and files that can be reset. The function first initializes empty vectors to store the target directories and files. It then checks which reset options were specified in the `ResetDataArgs` struct and adds the corresponding directories and files to the target vectors.

If the `--force` flag is not set and there are directories or files to be deleted, the function prompts the user to confirm the deletion. If the user confirms, the function iterates through the target directories and files and attempts to delete them using the `fs` module from the Rust standard library. If a deletion fails, the function increments an error counter.

If all deletions are successful, the function returns `Ok(())`. Otherwise, it returns `Err(ExitCode::Failure)`.

This function can be used as a utility function to reset various data for the ckb project, such as the database, network directories, and log files. It provides a convenient way to reset data without having to manually delete files and directories. For example, to reset the database, the following code can be used:

```
use ckb_app_config::ResetDataArgs;
use ckb::reset_data;

let args = ResetDataArgs {
    database: true,
    ..Default::default()
};

reset_data(args).unwrap();
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a function that resets data for the ckb project by deleting specified directories and files.

2. What are the possible targets for data reset?
- The possible targets for data reset include data directory, database path, network directory, network peer store path, and network secret key path.

3. What happens if there are errors during the data reset process?
- If there are errors during the data reset process, the function returns an `ExitCode` of `Failure`.
