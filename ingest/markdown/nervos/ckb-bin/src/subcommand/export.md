The `export` function in this code is responsible for exporting data from the ckb blockchain. It takes in two arguments: `args` of type `ExportArgs` and `async_handle` of type `Handle`. The `ExportArgs` struct contains configuration information for the export process, such as the binary name, root directory, and database. The `Handle` is used for asynchronous processing.

The function first creates a new `SharedBuilder` instance using the `SharedBuilder::new` method. This builder is used to create a shared state for the ckb node, which is necessary for exporting data. The `SharedBuilder` takes in several arguments, including the binary name, root directory, database, and async handle. If the builder cannot be created, an error is returned.

Once the builder is created, the `consensus` method is called on it with the `args.consensus` argument. This sets the consensus configuration for the shared state. The `build` method is then called on the builder to create the shared state. If the shared state cannot be created, an error is returned.

Finally, the `Export` struct is instantiated with the shared state and the `args.target` argument. The `execute` method is called on the `Export` instance to perform the export. If an error occurs during the export process, it is caught and an error message is printed to the console. The function returns either `Ok(())` if the export is successful or `Err(ExitCode::Failure)` if an error occurs.

This code is an important part of the ckb blockchain project as it allows users to export data from the blockchain for analysis or other purposes. It is likely used in conjunction with other functions and modules to provide a comprehensive set of tools for working with the ckb blockchain. Here is an example of how this function might be used:

```
use ckb_app_config::ExportArgs;
use ckb_async_runtime::Handle;

let args = ExportArgs {
    config: // configuration information,
    consensus: // consensus configuration,
    target: // export target,
};

let async_handle = Handle::current();
let result = export(args, async_handle);

match result {
    Ok(()) => println!("Export successful!"),
    Err(code) => println!("Export failed with exit code: {:?}", code),
}
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code exports data from a CKB node using the `Export` module and a `SharedBuilder` instance.

2. What arguments does the `export` function take?
   - The `export` function takes an `ExportArgs` struct and a `Handle` instance as arguments.

3. What does the `map_err` method do in this code?
   - The `map_err` method is used to convert an `Export` module error into an `ExitCode` error and print an error message to the console.
