The code defines a Rust module that is part of the ckb project. The module contains a function called `list_hashes` that lists the hashes of various system cells and dep groups in a ChainSpec. The ChainSpec is a configuration file that defines the rules of the blockchain, such as the consensus rules, the block reward, and the transaction fees. The ChainSpec is loaded from a file specified by the user or from a bundled file.

The `list_hashes` function takes two arguments: a root directory and a set of command-line arguments. The function first checks if the ChainSpec is bundled with the ckb project or if it is specified by the user. If the ChainSpec is bundled, the function loads all the bundled ChainSpecs and lists the hashes of their system cells and dep groups. If the ChainSpec is specified by the user, the function loads the ChainSpec and lists the hashes of its system cells and dep groups.

The `list_hashes` function uses the `TryFrom` trait to convert a `ChainSpec` object to a `SpecHashes` object. The `SpecHashes` struct contains the hashes of the system cells and dep groups in the ChainSpec. The `TryFrom` trait is used because the conversion can fail if the ChainSpec is invalid.

The `list_hashes` function uses the `LinkedHashMap` struct to store the hashes of the system cells and dep groups for each ChainSpec. The function then prints the hashes in either JSON or TOML format, depending on the user's choice.

Overall, this code is used to list the hashes of the system cells and dep groups in a ChainSpec. This information is useful for debugging and testing the ChainSpec.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SpecHashes` struct?
- The `SpecHashes` struct is used to store various hashes related to a chain specification, including the hash of the specification itself, the genesis block hash, and the hashes of system cells and dependency groups.

2. What is the `list_hashes` function used for?
- The `list_hashes` function takes a root directory and command line arguments as input, and outputs a list of hashes related to chain specifications in either JSON or TOML format. It loads chain specifications from either bundled resources or a configuration file in the root directory.

3. What is the significance of the `TryFrom` trait implementation for `SpecHashes`?
- The `TryFrom` trait implementation for `SpecHashes` allows a `ChainSpec` struct to be converted into a `SpecHashes` struct, returning an error of type `ExitCode` if the conversion fails. This conversion is used in the `list_hashes` function to obtain the hashes related to a chain specification.
