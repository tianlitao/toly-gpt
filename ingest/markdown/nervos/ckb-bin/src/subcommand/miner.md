The `miner` function in this code is responsible for setting up and running a CKB miner. CKB is a blockchain project, and mining is the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain by solving a cryptographic puzzle.

The `miner` function takes in two arguments: `args`, which is a struct containing configuration information for the miner, and `async_handle`, which is a handle to the asynchronous runtime used by the CKB node. The function returns a `Result` indicating whether the miner was able to start successfully or not.

The function begins by creating an unbounded channel for passing new work to the miner. It then extracts the `client` and `workers` fields from the `MinerConfig` struct contained in `args`. The `client` field is used to create a new `Client` instance, which is responsible for communicating with the CKB node and requesting new work to be done. The `workers` field is used to determine how many threads the miner should use to perform the work.

Next, the function creates a new `Miner` instance, passing in the `pow_engine` field from `args`, the `client` instance created earlier, the new work channel, the number of workers, and a limit on the number of solutions to be found. The `Miner` instance is responsible for actually performing the mining work.

The function then sets up a memory tracker to monitor the memory usage of the miner process. It spawns the `client` instance in the background, and starts a new thread to run the `Miner` instance. It also sets up a handler for the Ctrl-C signal, which will notify the `exit_handler` when the signal is received.

Finally, the function waits for the `exit_handler` to receive a notification that the miner should exit, and then cleans up the `client` and `Miner` instances before returning success.

Overall, this code sets up and runs a CKB miner, using multiple threads to perform the mining work and communicating with the CKB node to request new work. It also includes some additional functionality for monitoring memory usage and handling the Ctrl-C signal.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code?

   This code defines a function called `miner` that takes in `MinerArgs` and `Handle` as arguments and returns a `Result` with an `ExitCode`. The function sets up a miner and a client to mine blocks on the CKB blockchain.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?

   This code relies on several external dependencies, including `ckb_app_config`, `ckb_async_runtime`, `ckb_channel`, `ckb_miner`, `ckb_network`, `std::thread`, and `ctrlc`.

3. What is the role of the `exit_handler` variable?

   The `exit_handler` variable is an instance of the `DefaultExitHandler` struct from the `ckb_network` crate. It is used to handle the exit signal sent to the miner process, allowing it to gracefully shut down and release any resources it was using.
