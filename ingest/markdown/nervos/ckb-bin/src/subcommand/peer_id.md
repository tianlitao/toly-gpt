The `peer_id` function is a part of the `ckb` project and is used to print the base58-encoded peer ID of a node. The function takes in an argument of type `PeerIDArgs` which contains the peer ID of the node. The function returns a `Result` type with an empty tuple `()` as the success value and an `ExitCode` as the error value.

The purpose of this function is to provide a way to retrieve the peer ID of a node in the `ckb` network. This information can be useful for debugging and monitoring purposes. The function simply prints the peer ID to the console using the `println!` macro and returns a success value.

Here is an example of how this function can be used in the larger `ckb` project:

```rust
use ckb_app_config::{ExitCode, PeerIDArgs};

fn main() -> Result<(), ExitCode> {
    let peer_id_args = PeerIDArgs {
        peer_id: "QmXJZzJ7vGdKZzvzjNzJ1jv7J2JzZzJ7vGdKZzvzjNzJ1jv7J2Jz".to_string(),
    };
    peer_id(peer_id_args)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

In this example, we create a `PeerIDArgs` struct with a sample peer ID and pass it to the `peer_id` function. The function then prints the peer ID to the console. If the function returns an error, we propagate the error up the call stack using the `?` operator. Finally, we return a success value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ckb_app_config` crate and how is it being used in this code?
   - The `ckb_app_config` crate is being used to import the `PeerIDArgs` struct and `ExitCode` enum. It is unclear from this code snippet what the crate's overall purpose is.
2. What is the expected input for the `peer_id` function and what does it return?
   - The `peer_id` function expects an argument of type `PeerIDArgs` and returns a `Result` with an empty `Ok` value or an `ExitCode` value.
3. What is the significance of the `to_base58()` method being called on `args.peer_id`?
   - The `to_base58()` method is likely being used to convert the `peer_id` value to a base58-encoded string for display purposes. It is unclear from this code snippet what the `peer_id` value represents.
