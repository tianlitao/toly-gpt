The `import` function in this code is responsible for importing data into the CKB blockchain. It takes in two arguments: `args`, which is an instance of `ImportArgs` containing configuration information for the import, and `async_handle`, which is a handle to the asynchronous runtime used by the CKB node.

The function begins by creating a new `SharedBuilder` instance, which is used to configure and launch the CKB node. The `SharedBuilder` is initialized with the binary name, root directory, database configuration, and asynchronous handle provided in the `args` argument. It then calls the `consensus` method on the `builder` instance, passing in the consensus configuration from the `args` argument. This creates a new `Shared` instance, which is a shared state object used by the CKB node.

Next, the function creates a new `ChainService` instance using the `shared` object and a proposal table obtained from the `pack` object. The `ChainService` is responsible for managing the blockchain and validating new blocks. It then starts the `ChainService` by calling its `start` method, passing in a string identifier for the service.

After starting the `ChainService`, the function manually drops the `tx_pool_builder` and `relay_tx_receiver` objects from the `pack` object. These objects are used for transaction pool management and transaction relay, respectively.

Finally, the function creates a new `Import` instance, passing in the `chain_controller` object and the source of the data to be imported. The `execute` method of the `Import` instance is then called to begin the import process. If an error occurs during the import, the function prints an error message and returns an `ExitCode::Failure` value.

Overall, this code is an important part of the CKB project as it enables the import of data into the blockchain. This is a crucial feature for any blockchain project, as it allows users to add new data to the blockchain and extend its functionality. The `import` function can be used by developers and users of the CKB project to import data into the blockchain, such as new transactions or blocks. For example, a developer could use this function to import test data into the blockchain for testing purposes.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is for importing data into the CKB blockchain.
2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `import` function?
   - The `import` function takes in `ImportArgs` and `Handle` as inputs and returns a `Result` with an empty tuple or an `ExitCode`.
3. What is the role of the `ChainService` and `ChainController` in this code?
   - The `ChainService` is used to manage the blockchain data and the `ChainController` is used to control the `ChainService`. They are created and started in the `import` function to handle the imported data.
