The `run_app` function is the main entry point for the CKB executable. It takes a `Version` parameter and returns a `Result` with an empty `Ok` value if the process exits normally, or an `ExitCode` if there is an error. 

The function first sets the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to "full" to ensure that a full backtrace is printed on panic. It then extracts the binary name and command line arguments using the `get_bin_name_and_matches` function from the `ckb_app_config` module. 

If a subcommand is provided, the function matches it against a set of predefined commands and calls the corresponding function from the `subcommand` module. These commands include `init`, `list_hashes`, and `peerid`. If no subcommand is provided, the function matches the command against another set of predefined commands and calls the corresponding function from the `subcommand` module. These commands include `run`, `miner`, `replay`, `export`, `import`, `stats`, `reset_data`, `migrate`, and `db_repair`. 

The function then creates a new global runtime using the `new_global_runtime` function from the `ckb_async_runtime` module. It extracts the setup information from the command line arguments using the `from_matches` function from the `Setup` struct. It then creates a `SetupGuard` using the `from_setup` function from the `setup_guard` module. The `SetupGuard` is responsible for setting up the logging and other configuration options. 

The function raises the file descriptor limit using the `raise_fd_limit` function from the `helper` module. It then calls the appropriate subcommand function based on the command line arguments. 

Finally, the function sets a runtime shutdown timeout of 1 second using the `shutdown_timeout` function from the `ckb_async_runtime` module and returns the result of the subcommand function. 

The `is_silent_logging` function is a helper function that returns a boolean indicating whether the logging should be silent for a given command. This is used to determine whether to create a silent logger in the `SetupGuard`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `helper`, `setup_guard`, and `subcommand` modules?
   - The `helper` module likely contains utility functions used throughout the codebase, while `setup_guard` contains a guard that ensures proper setup and teardown of the application. The `subcommand` module likely contains the implementation of the various subcommands that can be run by the application.
2. What is the significance of the `RUNTIME_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` constant?
   - The `RUNTIME_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` constant is used to set the maximum amount of time the runtime will wait for tasks to complete during shutdown before forcibly terminating them.
3. What is the purpose of the `is_silent_logging` function?
   - The `is_silent_logging` function returns a boolean indicating whether or not logging should be silent for a given command. This is used to determine whether or not to create a `SetupGuard` with silent logging.
