The code above is part of the ckb project and contains functions related to deadlock detection and raising the soft open file descriptor resource limit to the hard resource limit.

The `deadlock_detection` function is conditionally compiled based on the `deadlock_detection` feature. If the feature is not enabled, the function does nothing. If the feature is enabled, the function sets up a thread that runs every 10 seconds to check for deadlocks using the `parking_lot` crate. If any deadlocks are detected, a warning message is logged with information about the threads involved in the deadlock.

The `prompt` function prompts the user for input and returns the input as a string. It does this by writing the prompt message to standard output, flushing the output, and then reading a line of input from standard input.

The `raise_fd_limit` function raises the soft open file descriptor resource limit to the hard resource limit. This is done using the `fdlimit` crate, which provides a cross-platform way to raise the file descriptor limit. The function logs the newly-increased limit using the `ckb_logger` crate.

These functions are likely used in different parts of the ckb project. For example, the `prompt` function could be used to get user input for a command-line interface, while the `raise_fd_limit` function could be used to increase the file descriptor limit for a network server. The `deadlock_detection` function could be used to detect and log deadlocks in a concurrent part of the codebase.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `deadlock_detection` function and how is it used?
- The `deadlock_detection` function is used to detect deadlocks in the program when the `deadlock_detection` feature is enabled. It spawns a thread that checks for deadlocks every 10 seconds and logs any detected deadlocks.

2. What is the purpose of the `prompt` function and how is it used?
- The `prompt` function is used to display a message to the user and read input from the command line. It takes a message string as input and returns the user's input as a string.

3. What is the purpose of the `raise_fd_limit` function and when might it be useful?
- The `raise_fd_limit` function raises the soft open file descriptor resource limit to the hard resource limit. It might be useful on Mac OS X systems where the default soft limit of 256 file descriptors is too low for multithreaded scheduler testing, depending on the number of cores available.
