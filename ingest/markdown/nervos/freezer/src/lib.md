The code defines a module called `ckb` that contains two sub-modules `freezer` and `freezer_files`, as well as a test module. The purpose of this module is to provide an implementation of a memory-mapped append-only database for storing immutable chain data into flat files. 

The `Freezer` struct is the main component of this module and is exposed for use by other parts of the project. It is responsible for managing the memory-mapped files and providing an interface for reading and writing data to them. The `FreezerFilesBuilder` struct is used to create new instances of the `Freezer` struct with specific configuration options.

The `internal_error` function is a utility function that creates an `Error` object with an `InternalErrorKind` and a reason for the error. This function is used throughout the module to provide consistent error handling.

Overall, this module provides a critical component for the larger project by allowing it to efficiently store and retrieve immutable chain data. Here is an example of how the `Freezer` struct might be used:

```rust
use ckb::Freezer;

let freezer = Freezer::new("/path/to/data", 1024 * 1024 * 1024).unwrap();

// Write some data to the freezer
let data = vec![1, 2, 3];
let offset = freezer.write(&data).unwrap();

// Read the data back from the freezer
let read_data = freezer.read(offset, data.len()).unwrap();
assert_eq!(data, read_data);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Freezer` and `FreezerFilesBuilder` structs?
- The `Freezer` struct is a memory mapped append-only database used to store immutable chain data into flat files, while the `FreezerFilesBuilder` struct is used to build and configure the `Freezer` database.
 
2. What is the `internal_error` function used for?
- The `internal_error` function is used to create an `Error` instance with an `InternalErrorKind` of `Database` and a custom error message.

3. What is the purpose of the `tests` module?
- The `tests` module contains unit tests for the `ckb` project.
