The code defines an RPC module called `StatsRpc` that provides two methods for getting statistics about the CKB blockchain. The `get_blockchain_info` method returns information about the current state of the blockchain, including the chain ID, difficulty, epoch, and median time. It also returns any active alerts that have been issued by the network. The `get_deployments_info` method returns information about the current state of any protocol upgrades that have been deployed to the network. 

The `StatsRpc` module is implemented by the `StatsRpcImpl` struct, which contains a reference to the shared state of the CKB node and an alert notifier. The `get_blockchain_info` method retrieves the current tip header and median time from the shared state, as well as the current consensus rules. It then constructs a `ChainInfo` struct containing this information, as well as any active alerts that have been issued by the network. The `get_deployments_info` method retrieves the current tip header and snapshot from the shared state, as well as the current consensus rules. It then constructs a `DeploymentsInfo` struct containing information about any protocol upgrades that have been deployed to the network, including their activation status and deployment state.

This code is part of the larger CKB project, which is a decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications. The `StatsRpc` module provides a way for developers to query the current state of the blockchain and any active protocol upgrades, which can be useful for monitoring the health of the network and planning future upgrades. Developers can use the `ckb-rpc` library to interact with the `StatsRpc` module and retrieve this information programmatically. For example, to retrieve the current blockchain info using the `ckb-rpc` library, a developer could use the following code:

```rust
use ckb_jsonrpc_types::ChainInfo;
use ckb_jsonrpc::StatsRpcClient;
use jsonrpc_core_client::transports::http;

let transport = http::connect("http://localhost:8114").unwrap();
let client = StatsRpcClient::new(transport);
let chain_info: ChainInfo = client.get_blockchain_info().unwrap();
println!("{:?}", chain_info);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an RPC module for getting various statistic data about the ckb blockchain, including chain information and deployment information.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external crates, including `ckb_jsonrpc_types`, `ckb_network_alert`, `ckb_shared`, `ckb_traits`, `ckb_types`, `ckb_util`, and `jsonrpc_core`.

3. What are the main functions provided by this code?
- This code provides two functions: `get_blockchain_info` and `get_deployments_info`. The former returns statistics about the chain, including alerts, chain ID, difficulty, epoch, median time, and whether the chain is in initial block download mode. The latter returns information about deployments, including the hash and epoch of the current tip block, as well as the state of each deployment.
