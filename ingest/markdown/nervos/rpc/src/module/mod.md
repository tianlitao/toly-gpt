This file contains documentation for the CKB RPC modules. The purpose of this code is to provide a reference for developers who want to use the CKB RPC interface to interact with the CKB blockchain. The RPC document is generated by Rust Doc, so it will take some concept conversions to map from the Rust structures to the JSONRPC.

The file lists all the RPC modules, including Net, Pool, Miner, Chain, Stats, Subscription, and Experiment. The default enabled modules are "Net", "Pool", "Miner", "Chain", "Stats", "Subscription", "Experiment". The file also lists all the RPC methods in the module, such as `send_transaction` in the module `PoolRpc`.

The file provides a JSON cheatsheet that shows how to map Rust std-lib structures into JSON values. The cheatsheet includes Rust structures such as `()`, `bool`, `String`, `Option<T>`, and `Vec<T>`. The file also provides examples of how to serialize Rust structures such as `OutPoint` and `Status` into JSON objects.

The file also explains the JSONRPC deprecation process for CKB RPC methods. A CKB RPC method is deprecated in three steps. First, the method is marked as deprecated in the CKB release notes and RPC document. Second, the CKB dev team will disable any deprecated RPC methods starting from the next minor version release. Third, once a deprecated method is disabled, the CKB dev team will remove it in a future minor version release.

Overall, this file provides a comprehensive reference for developers who want to use the CKB RPC interface to interact with the CKB blockchain.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?

   This code file contains the RPC modules for the ckb project, which allows enabling and disabling RPC methods by modules. The file also provides documentation on how to map Rust structures to JSONRPC.

2. How are RPC methods deprecated in the ckb project?

   RPC methods in the ckb project are deprecated in three steps. First, the method is marked as deprecated in the CKB release notes and RPC document. Then, the CKB dev team will disable any deprecated RPC methods starting from the next minor version release. Finally, once a deprecated method is disabled, the CKB dev team will remove it in a future minor version release.

3. What is the JSON cheatsheet for the ckb project?

   The JSON cheatsheet for the ckb project shows how to map Rust std-lib structures into JSON values. The cheatsheet includes mappings for `()`, `bool`, `String`, `Option<T>`, and `Vec<T>`. The project does not use JSON numbers due to precision problems, and integers are encoded as 0x-prefixed hex strings. The cheatsheet also provides examples of how to serialize Rust structs and enums as JSON objects and strings, respectively.
