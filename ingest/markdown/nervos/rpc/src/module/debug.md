The `DebugRpc` module is a collection of internal RPC methods for debugging purposes in the CKB project. This module is not guaranteed to be compatible and the methods may be changed or removed without advanced notification.

The module contains three methods: `jemalloc_profiling_dump`, `update_main_logger`, and `set_extra_logger`.

The `jemalloc_profiling_dump` method dumps jemalloc memory profiling information into a file. The file is stored in the server running the CKB node. The method returns the path to the dumped file on success or returns an error on failure.

The `update_main_logger` method changes the main logger config options while CKB is running. The method takes a `MainLoggerConfig` struct as input, which contains filter, to_stdout, to_file, and color options. If all options are `None`, the method returns `Ok(())`. Otherwise, the method updates the main logger with the new options and returns `Ok(())`. If an error occurs during the update, the method returns an error.

The `set_extra_logger` method sets logger config options for extra loggers. CKB nodes allow setting up extra loggers, which have their own log files and only append logs to their log files. The method takes a logger name and an optional `ExtraLoggerConfig` struct as input. If the logger name is invalid, the method returns an error. If the `ExtraLoggerConfig` struct is not `None`, the method adds a new logger or updates an existing logger with the new config options. If the `ExtraLoggerConfig` struct is `None`, the method removes the logger. If an error occurs during the update or removal, the method returns an error.

The `DebugRpcImpl` struct implements the `DebugRpc` trait and provides the implementation for each method.

Overall, the `DebugRpc` module provides internal RPC methods for debugging purposes in the CKB project. These methods allow developers to dump memory profiling information, update the main logger config options, and set logger config options for extra loggers.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines an RPC module called DebugRpc that contains three methods for debugging purposes.

2. What is the significance of the `#[rpc(server)]` and `#[doc(hidden)]` attributes?
- The `#[rpc(server)]` attribute indicates that this trait is an RPC server, and the `#[doc(hidden)]` attribute hides this module's documentation from the generated documentation.

3. What is the purpose of the `jemalloc_profiling_dump` method?
- The `jemalloc_profiling_dump` method dumps jemalloc memory profiling information into a file and returns the path to the dumped file on success or returns an error on failure.
