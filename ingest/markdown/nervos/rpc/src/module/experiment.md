The `ExperimentRpc` module is a collection of experimental methods for debugging and testing purposes. It is marked as experimental, meaning that the methods may be removed or changed in future releases without prior notifications.

The module contains two methods: `dry_run_transaction` and `calculate_dao_maximum_withdraw`.

`dry_run_transaction` is used to debug transaction scripts and query how many cycles the scripts consume. It takes a transaction as input and returns the execution cycles. This method does not check the transaction validity, but only runs the lock script and type script.

`calculate_dao_maximum_withdraw` is used to calculate the maximum withdrawal one can get, given a referenced DAO cell and a withdrawing block hash. It takes an `OutPoint` and a `DaoWithdrawingCalculationKind` as input and returns the final capacity when the cell `OutPoint` is withdrawn using the block hash or withdrawing phase 1 transaction out point as the reference.

The `ExperimentRpcImpl` struct implements the `ExperimentRpc` trait. It contains a `Shared` instance, which is a shared state of the CKB node. The `dry_run_transaction` method takes a `Transaction` as input, converts it to a `packed::Transaction`, and runs it using the `CyclesEstimator` module. The `calculate_dao_maximum_withdraw` method takes an `OutPoint` and a `DaoWithdrawingCalculationKind` as input, and calculates the maximum withdrawal using the `DaoCalculator` module.

Overall, the `ExperimentRpc` module provides experimental methods for debugging and testing purposes. These methods may be removed or changed in future releases without prior notifications.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains an RPC module for experimenting with methods, including dry running a transaction and calculating the maximum withdrawal for a DAO cell.

2. What is the meaning of the `#[rpc(server)]` and `#[rpc(name = "...")]` attributes?
- The `#[rpc(server)]` attribute indicates that this trait defines an RPC server, while the `#[rpc(name = "...")]` attribute specifies the name of an RPC method.

3. What is the purpose of the `DaoCalculator` struct and how is it used in this code?
- The `DaoCalculator` struct is used to calculate the maximum withdrawal for a DAO cell, given a referenced DAO cell and a withdrawing block hash or withdrawing phase 1 transaction out point. It is instantiated with the consensus and data loader, and its `calculate_maximum_withdraw` method is called with the relevant inputs to perform the calculation.
