The code defines a `FeeRateProvider` trait and a `FeeRateCollector` struct that collects fee rate related information. The `FeeRateProvider` trait defines methods to get the tip block number, get block extension by block number, and get the maximum target. The `FeeRateCollector` struct takes a `FeeRateProvider` as input and has a `statistics` method that returns a `FeeRateStatics` struct. 

The `statistics` method takes an optional `target` parameter, which is set to a default value of 21 if not provided. If the `target` is even, it is incremented by 1. The `target` is then clamped to the maximum target defined by the `FeeRateProvider`. 

The `provider.collect` method is called with the `target` and a closure that takes a mutable vector of fee rates and a block extension as input and returns a mutable vector of fee rates. The `collect` method iterates over block extensions from the start block number to the tip block number and applies the closure to each block extension. The closure checks if the block extension has non-empty transaction fees, cycles, and transaction sizes. If so, it calculates the fee rate for each transaction and adds it to the vector of fee rates. 

After collecting all the fee rates, the `statistics` method checks if the vector of fee rates is empty. If so, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the mean and median of the fee rates and returns a `FeeRateStatics` struct with the mean and median values. 

This code is used to collect fee rate statistics for the CKB blockchain. The `FeeRateProvider` trait is implemented for the `Snapshot` struct, which represents a snapshot of the blockchain state. The `FeeRateCollector` struct is used to collect fee rate statistics for a given `Snapshot`. The `statistics` method can be called with an optional `target` parameter to collect fee rate statistics for a specific target. The `FeeRateStatics` struct can be used to store and display the mean and median fee rates. 

Example usage:

```rust
use ckb_jsonrpc_types::FeeRateStatics;
use ckb_shared::Snapshot;
use ckb_store::ChainStore;
use ckb_types::core::{BlockExt, BlockNumber};
use ckb_fee_rate::FeeRateCollector;

// create a snapshot of the blockchain state
let snapshot = Snapshot::new(&store);

// create a fee rate collector with the snapshot as the provider
let collector = FeeRateCollector::new(&snapshot);

// collect fee rate statistics for the default target (21)
let stats = collector.statistics(None);

// print the mean and median fee rates
match stats {
    Some(FeeRateStatics { mean, median }) => {
        println!("Mean fee rate: {}", mean);
        println!("Median fee rate: {}", median);
    }
    None => println!("No fee rate statistics available"),
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a trait `FeeRateProvider` and a struct `FeeRateCollector` that collects fee rate related information using the `FeeRateProvider` trait.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external crates: `ckb_jsonrpc_types`, `ckb_shared`, `ckb_store`, `ckb_types`, and `itertools`.

3. What is the significance of the constants `DEFAULT_TARGET`, `MIN_TARGET`, and `MAX_TARGET`?
- `DEFAULT_TARGET` is the default target for collecting fee rates, `MIN_TARGET` is the minimum target, and `MAX_TARGET` is the maximum target. These constants are used to determine the range of block numbers to collect fee rates from.
