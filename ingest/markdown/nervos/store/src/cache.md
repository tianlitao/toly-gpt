The `StoreCache` struct is a cache for various data related to the CKB blockchain. It contains several `Mutex`-protected `LruCache` instances, each with a different purpose. 

The `headers` cache stores `HeaderView` instances, which represent block headers. The `cell_data` cache stores `(Bytes, Byte32)` tuples, where the `Bytes` represent cell data and the `Byte32` represents the hash of the cell data. The `cell_data_hash` cache stores `Byte32` hashes of cell data. The `block_proposals` cache stores `ProposalShortIdVec` instances, which represent proposals for new transactions to be included in a block. The `block_tx_hashes` cache stores `Vec<Byte32>` instances, which represent transaction hashes for a given block. The `block_uncles` cache stores `UncleBlockVecView` instances, which represent uncle blocks for a given block. Finally, the `block_extensions` cache stores `Option<packed::Bytes>` instances, which represent block extension sections.

The purpose of this cache is to improve performance by reducing the number of disk reads required to access frequently-used data. By storing this data in memory, the cache can quickly return the requested data without having to read it from disk. 

The `from_config` method creates a new `StoreCache` instance with the specified cache sizes. The `Default` implementation for `StoreCache` creates a new instance with default cache sizes. 

Example usage:

```rust
use ckb_app_config::StoreConfig;
use ckb_store::StoreCache;

let config = StoreConfig::default();
let cache = StoreCache::from_config(config);

// Insert some data into the headers cache
let header = get_some_header_view();
let hash = header.hash();
cache.headers.lock().insert(hash, header);

// Retrieve the data from the headers cache
let cached_header = cache.headers.lock().get(&hash);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   
   This code defines a struct called `StoreCache` that contains several LRU caches for storing various types of data related to blocks and headers in the CKB blockchain. It also provides methods for creating a new `StoreCache` instance from a `StoreConfig` object and for getting the default `StoreCache` instance.
   
2. What is the significance of the `Mutex` type used in this code?
   
   The `Mutex` type is used to provide thread-safe access to the LRU caches stored in the `StoreCache` struct. This ensures that multiple threads can access and modify the caches without causing data races or other synchronization issues.
   
3. What is the purpose of the `TODO` comments in this code?
   
   The `TODO` comments indicate that there is some missing or incomplete documentation for certain parts of the code, specifically the purpose of the various caches stored in the `StoreCache` struct. These comments are likely intended to remind the developer to fill in the missing documentation at a later time.
