The `StoreWriteBatch` struct is a wrapper around a RocksDB write batch, which is a collection of write operations that can be executed atomically. This struct provides methods for inserting and deleting data from the database, as well as some utility methods for checking the size and state of the batch.

The `put` method inserts a key-value pair into the batch for a given column. The `delete` method removes a key-value pair from the batch for a given column. Both methods return an error if the operation fails.

The `size_in_bytes` method returns the serialized size of the batch in bytes. The `len` method returns the number of operations in the batch. The `is_empty` method returns true if the batch is empty.

The `clear` method removes all operations from the batch. This method returns an error if the operation fails.

The `insert_cells` method inserts a batch of cell data into the database. It takes an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains an out point, a cell entry, and an optional cell data entry. The method inserts the cell entry into the `COLUMN_CELL` column, and if a cell data entry is present, it inserts the cell data and its hash into the `COLUMN_CELL_DATA` and `COLUMN_CELL_DATA_HASH` columns, respectively.

The `delete_cells` method removes a batch of cells from the database. It takes an iterator of out points, and for each out point, it removes the corresponding cell entry, cell data, and cell data hash from the database.

The `delete_block_body` method removes the block body from the database for a given block number, block hash, and transaction length. It removes the uncle, extension, and proposal IDs from the `COLUMN_BLOCK_UNCLE`, `COLUMN_BLOCK_EXTENSION`, and `COLUMN_BLOCK_PROPOSAL_IDS` columns, respectively. It also removes the number-hash mapping from the `COLUMN_NUMBER_HASH` column. Finally, it removes the transaction keys and their corresponding data from the `COLUMN_BLOCK_BODY` column.

The `delete_block` method removes an entire block from the database for a given block number, block hash, and transaction length. It removes the block header from the `COLUMN_BLOCK_HEADER` column, and then calls `delete_block_body` to remove the block body.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a struct `StoreWriteBatch` that provides methods for putting, deleting, and inserting cells and blocks into a RocksDB database.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `ckb_db` and `ckb_db_schema` crates for interacting with the database, as well as the `ckb_error` crate for error handling and the `ckb_types` crate for defining blockchain data types.

3. What methods are available for inserting and deleting cells and blocks?
- The `StoreWriteBatch` struct provides methods for inserting and deleting cells (`insert_cells`, `delete_cells`) and blocks (`delete_block_body`, `delete_block`) from the database. These methods take in various parameters such as the block number, block hash, and transaction length.
