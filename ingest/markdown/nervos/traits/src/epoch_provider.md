The code defines a trait called `EpochProvider` which is used for epoch storage. The trait has four methods that allow getting epoch information based on block headers and numbers. The `get_epoch_ext` method returns the corresponding `EpochExt` for a given block header. The `get_block_hash` method returns the block header hash for a given block number. The `get_block_ext` method returns the `BlockExt` for a given block header hash. The `get_block_header` method returns the `HeaderView` for a given block header hash.

The trait also has a method called `get_block_epoch` which returns the corresponding epoch progress information for a given block header. This method first calls the `get_epoch_ext` method to get the epoch information for the block header. It then checks if the block is the tail block of the epoch or not. If it is, it calculates and returns additional statistics such as the epoch uncles count and duration. If it is not, it simply returns the epoch information.

The `BlockEpoch` enum is used to represent the progress of a block's corresponding epoch. It has two variants: `TailBlock` and `NonTailBlock`. The `TailBlock` variant is used for the tail block of an epoch and provides additional statistics for next epoch generating or verifying. The `NonTailBlock` variant is used for non-tail blocks of an epoch.

The `BlockEpoch` enum has a method called `epoch` which returns the epoch information for the block. This method matches on the enum variant and returns the epoch information accordingly.

This code is used in the larger project to provide epoch information for blocks. It allows for easy retrieval of epoch information based on block headers and numbers. The `get_block_epoch` method is particularly useful for getting additional statistics for tail blocks of epochs. The `BlockEpoch` enum provides a convenient way to represent the progress of a block's corresponding epoch. Overall, this code is an important part of the ckb project's functionality for handling epochs.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `EpochProvider` trait and what methods does it define?
- The `EpochProvider` trait is used for epoch storage and defines methods for getting epoch-related information such as `get_epoch_ext`, `get_block_hash`, `get_block_ext`, and `get_block_header`.
2. What is the `BlockEpoch` enum and what information does it contain?
- The `BlockEpoch` enum represents the progress of a block's corresponding epoch and contains information such as the epoch itself, the number of uncles in the epoch, and the duration of the epoch.
3. What is the purpose of the `get_block_epoch` method and how does it determine whether a block is a tail block or not?
- The `get_block_epoch` method returns the corresponding epoch progress information for a given block header. It determines whether a block is a tail block by checking if its block number is equal to the start number of the epoch plus its length minus one. If it is a tail block, it calculates additional information such as the number of uncles in the epoch and the epoch duration.
