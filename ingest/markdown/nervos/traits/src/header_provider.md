The code defines a trait called `HeaderProvider` that provides methods for retrieving header information for a given block hash. The trait has three methods: `get_header`, `timestamp_and_parent`, and `block_median_time`.

The `get_header` method takes a block hash and returns the corresponding header view. If the header does not exist, it returns `None`.

The `timestamp_and_parent` method takes a block hash and returns a tuple containing the timestamp, block number, and parent hash of the corresponding block. If the header does not exist, it panics.

The `block_median_time` method takes a block hash and a median block count and returns the median timestamp of the past `median_block_count` blocks, including the timestamp of the given block. It does this by repeatedly calling `timestamp_and_parent` to retrieve the timestamps of the previous blocks, sorting them, and returning the median value.

The trait is implemented for a boxed closure that takes a block hash and returns the corresponding header view. This allows for flexibility in how the header information is retrieved, as different implementations can be used depending on the context.

Overall, this code provides a way to retrieve header information for a given block hash, including timestamps and parent hashes, and to calculate the median timestamp of a set of blocks. This information can be used in various ways throughout the larger project, such as for validating blocks or calculating mining difficulty.

Example usage:

```
use ckb_types::packed::Byte32;

// Define a struct that implements the HeaderProvider trait
struct MyHeaderProvider;

impl HeaderProvider for MyHeaderProvider {
    fn get_header(&self, hash: &Byte32) -> Option<HeaderView> {
        // implementation goes here
    }
}

// Create an instance of the struct
let provider = MyHeaderProvider;

// Call the block_median_time method to get the median timestamp of the past 10 blocks
let block_hash = Byte32::zero();
let median_time = provider.block_median_time(&block_hash, 10);
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `HeaderProvider` trait?
   - The `HeaderProvider` trait is used for header storage and provides methods to get the header of a given block hash, timestamp and block number of a block hash, and past block median time.
2. What does the `timestamp_and_parent` method return if the parent header does not exist?
   - If the parent header does not exist, the `timestamp_and_parent` method will panic with the message "parent header exist".
3. What is the purpose of the `impl` block at the end of the code?
   - The `impl` block provides an implementation of the `get_header` method for a `Box<dyn Fn(Byte32) -> Option<HeaderView>>`, which allows a closure that takes a `Byte32` and returns an `Option<HeaderView>` to be used as a `HeaderProvider`.
