The `LoadWitness` struct and its implementation provide a system call for the CKB VM to load a witness from a transaction. Witnesses are used to provide additional data to a transaction, such as signatures or proofs. The `LoadWitness` struct takes in a `ResolvedTransaction`, which is a transaction with all inputs resolved to their corresponding cells, and two `Indices` structs representing the indices of the inputs and outputs in the transaction group.

The `fetch_witness` method takes in a `Source` enum and an index, and returns the corresponding witness if it exists. The `Source` enum specifies whether to look for the witness in the input or output group, or in the transaction itself. If the witness is not found, the method returns `None`.

The `Syscalls` trait is implemented for `LoadWitness`, which provides the `initialize` and `ecall` methods. The `initialize` method does nothing and returns `Ok(())`. The `ecall` method is called when the VM executes the `LOAD_WITNESS_SYSCALL_NUMBER` system call. It retrieves the index and source from the VM's registers, calls `fetch_witness` to get the witness, and stores the witness data in the VM's memory using the `store_data` utility function. If the witness is not found, it sets the return value to `INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUND`. Otherwise, it sets the return value to `SUCCESS` and adds the number of bytes written to the VM's cycle count.

This code is used in the larger CKB project to provide a way for scripts to access witnesses in a transaction. For example, a script could use this system call to verify a signature in a witness. The `LoadWitness` struct is instantiated with the resolved transaction and the indices of the inputs and outputs in the transaction group, and then passed to the VM as a system call implementation. When the script executes, it can call the `LOAD_WITNESS_SYSCALL_NUMBER` system call to retrieve the witness it needs.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `LoadWitness` struct and how is it used in the code?

   The `LoadWitness` struct is used to load a witness from a transaction and expose it to the CKB VM. It is used as a Syscall in the `ecall` function to fetch the witness data and store it in the VM's memory.

2. What is the `fetch_witness` function doing and how is it used in the code?

   The `fetch_witness` function takes a `Source` and an index as input and returns the corresponding witness data from the transaction. It is used in the `ecall` function to fetch the witness data based on the input parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `transferred_byte_cycles` function and how is it used in the code?

   The `transferred_byte_cycles` function calculates the number of cycles required to transfer a given number of bytes. It is used in the `ecall` function to calculate the number of cycles required to store the witness data in the VM's memory.
