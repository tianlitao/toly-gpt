The code defines a transaction verification environment for the ckb project. The environment is used to determine the phase of a transaction and the earliest block in which it will be committed. The `TxVerifyPhase` enum defines the three possible phases of a transaction: `Submitted`, `Proposed`, and `Committed`. The `TxVerifyEnv` struct defines the environment of a transaction and has methods to create a new environment for each phase of a transaction.

The `TxVerifyEnv` struct has five private fields: `phase`, `number`, `epoch`, `hash`, and `parent_hash`. The `phase` field is of type `TxVerifyPhase` and represents the current phase of the transaction. The `number` field is of type `BlockNumber` and represents the block number of the current tip. The `epoch` field is of type `EpochNumberWithFraction` and represents the epoch number of the current tip. The `hash` field is of type `Byte32` and represents the hash of the current tip. The `parent_hash` field is of type `Byte32` and represents the hash of the parent block of the current tip.

The `TxVerifyEnv` struct has four methods to create a new environment for each phase of a transaction. The `new_submit` method creates a new environment for a transaction that has just been submitted. The input is the current tip header. The `new_proposed` method creates a new environment for a transaction that has already been proposed before several blocks. The input is the current tip header and how many blocks have been passed since the transaction was proposed. The `new_commit` method creates a new environment for a transaction that will be committed in the current block. The input is the current tip header.

The `TxVerifyEnv` struct has three methods to determine the earliest block in which the transaction will be committed. The `block_number` method returns the block number of the earliest block in which the transaction will be committed. The input is the proposal window, which is used to calculate the number of blocks that need to be waited before the transaction can be committed. The `epoch_number` method returns the epoch number of the earliest epoch in which the transaction will be committed. The input is the proposal window, which is used to calculate the number of blocks that need to be waited before the transaction can be committed. The `parent_hash` method returns the parent block hash of the earliest block in which the transaction will be committed. The `epoch` method returns the earliest epoch in which the transaction will be committed. The `epoch_number_without_proposal_window` method returns the epoch number of the earliest epoch in which the transaction will be committed without considering the proposal window.

Overall, this code provides a way to determine the earliest block in which a transaction will be committed based on the current tip header and the phase of the transaction. This information can be used in the larger project to optimize transaction processing and ensure that transactions are committed in a timely manner.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TxVerifyEnv` struct and its associated methods?
- The `TxVerifyEnv` struct represents the environment that transactions are in, and its methods provide information about when a transaction will be proposed and committed based on the current tip header and the number of blocks that have passed since the transaction was proposed.

2. What is the `TxVerifyPhase` enum and what are its possible values?
- The `TxVerifyPhase` enum represents the phase that a transaction is in, and its possible values are `Submitted`, `Proposed`, and `Committed`. `Submitted` indicates that the transaction has just been submitted, `Proposed` indicates that the transaction has already been proposed before several blocks, and `Committed` indicates that the transaction is committed.

3. Why does the `parent_hash` method return a cloned `Byte32` value?
- The `parent_hash` method returns a cloned `Byte32` value because the `Byte32` type does not implement the `Copy` trait, so it cannot be moved out of the match expression. Therefore, a cloned value is returned instead.
