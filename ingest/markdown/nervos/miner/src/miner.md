The `Miner` struct is a component of the ckb project that is responsible for mining new blocks on the blockchain. It uses a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm to find a nonce that, when combined with the block header, produces a hash that meets a certain difficulty target. The `Miner` struct receives new work from the `work_rx` channel and distributes it to a set of worker threads. Each worker thread runs the PoW algorithm on the work and sends the resulting nonce back to the `Miner` struct via the `nonce_rx` channel. The `Miner` struct then combines the nonce with the work to create a new block and submits it to the blockchain via the `client` object.

The `Miner` struct is initialized with a set of worker configurations, which specify the number of threads to use and other parameters. It also takes a `limit` parameter, which specifies the maximum number of nonces to find before stopping. This is useful for testing and debugging purposes.

The `Miner` struct uses an LRU cache to keep track of tasks that have already been submitted. This is necessary because the blockchain allows for the creation of uncle blocks, which are blocks that are not part of the main chain but are still valid. When a worker thread finds a nonce that produces an uncle block, the `Miner` struct checks if the parent block has already been submitted. If it has, the uncle block is discarded. Otherwise, the uncle block is submitted to the blockchain.

The `Miner` struct also uses a progress bar to display the number of nonces found and the total number of nonces to find. This is useful for monitoring the progress of the mining process.

Overall, the `Miner` struct is a critical component of the ckb project that is responsible for creating new blocks on the blockchain. It uses a set of worker threads to perform the PoW algorithm and submits new blocks to the blockchain via the `client` object. The `Miner` struct also handles the creation of uncle blocks and uses a progress bar to display the progress of the mining process.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a `Miner` struct and its implementation, which is responsible for mining new blocks using proof-of-work algorithm.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on several external crates, including `ckb_app_config`, `ckb_channel`, `ckb_logger`, `ckb_pow`, `ckb_stop_handler`, `ckb_types`, `indicatif`, and `lru`.

3. What is the role of the `WorkerController` struct in this code?
- The `WorkerController` struct is used to manage and communicate with worker threads that perform the actual proof-of-work calculations. The `Miner` struct creates and holds a vector of `WorkerController` instances, and sends messages to them using the `send_message` method.
