The `ckb` project contains a module that defines a `Client` struct and a `Rpc` struct. The `Client` struct is responsible for communicating with a CKB node via RPC calls to obtain block templates and submit new blocks. The `Rpc` struct is a helper struct that abstracts away the details of making HTTP requests to the CKB node.

The `Client` struct has several methods, including `new`, which creates a new instance of the `Client` struct, and `submit_block`, which submits a new block to the CKB node. The `Client` struct also has a `spawn_background` method, which spawns a background process to periodically fetch new block templates from the CKB node.

The `Rpc` struct has a `new` method, which creates a new instance of the `Rpc` struct, and a `request` method, which sends an RPC request to the CKB node and returns a future that resolves to the response from the node.

The code also defines several helper functions, including `parse_response`, which parses an RPC response into a specified type, and `parse_authorization`, which parses the authorization header from a URI.

Overall, this code provides a way for the `ckb` project to communicate with a CKB node via RPC calls to obtain block templates and submit new blocks. The `Client` struct abstracts away the details of making RPC calls, while the `Rpc` struct provides a simple interface for making HTTP requests to the CKB node.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `Rpc` struct and how is it used?

   The `Rpc` struct is used to make JSON-RPC requests to a CKB node. It has a `request` method that takes a method name and parameters, and returns a future that resolves to the JSON-RPC response. It also has a `new` method that initializes a new `Rpc` instance with a given URI and handle.

2. What is the purpose of the `Client` struct and how is it used?

   The `Client` struct is used to manage mining operations and communicate with a CKB node. It has a `new` method that initializes a new `Client` instance with a given `MinerClientConfig` and handle. It also has methods for fetching and updating block templates, submitting blocks, and listening for block template notifications.

3. What is the purpose of the `handle` field in the `Client` struct?

   The `handle` field is a reference to a `Handle` instance from the `ckb_async_runtime` crate. It is used to spawn tasks that run concurrently with the main thread of execution, such as fetching block templates and submitting blocks.
