The code in this file provides utilities for the tokio runtime, which is a runtime for writing asynchronous Rust applications. The `Handle` struct is a newtype wrapper around `tokio::Handle`, which is used to decouple the `ckb` project from the `tokio` dependency. 

The `Handle` struct provides several methods for interacting with the tokio runtime. The `enter` method allows the user to enter the runtime context, which is necessary for constructing types that require an executor on creation, such as `tokio::time::Sleep` or `tokio::net::TcpStream`. The `spawn` method spawns a future onto the runtime's executor, while the `block_on` method runs a future to completion on the tokio runtime from a synchronous context. The `spawn_blocking` method spawns a future onto the runtime's blocking executor. Finally, the `into_inner` method transforms the `Handle` struct into the inner tokio handler.

The `new_global_runtime` function creates a new threaded_scheduler tokio runtime and returns a `Handle` and a `Runtime`. The `new_background_runtime` function creates a new threaded_scheduler tokio runtime and returns a `Handle` and a `StopHandler`. The `StopHandler` is used to stop the background thread when the runtime is no longer needed.

The `Spawn` trait is implemented for the `Handle` struct, which allows the user to spawn a task onto the runtime's executor.

Overall, this file provides a way for the `ckb` project to interact with the tokio runtime in a decoupled way, allowing for greater flexibility and modularity in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Handle` struct and its methods?
   
   The `Handle` struct is a newtype wrap and unwrap tokio::Handle, which is a workaround with Rust Orphan Rules. Its methods allow the user to enter the runtime context, spawn a future onto the runtime, run a future to completion on the Tokio runtime from a synchronous context, and spawn a future onto the runtime blocking pool.

2. What is the difference between `new_global_runtime()` and `new_background_runtime()`?
   
   `new_global_runtime()` creates a new threaded_scheduler tokio Runtime and returns a `Handle` and a `Runtime`. `new_background_runtime()` also creates a new threaded_scheduler tokio Runtime, but it returns a `Handle` and a `StopHandler<()>`, which includes a `SignalSender` and a background thread join handle.

3. What is the purpose of the `Spawn` trait and its implementation for `Handle`?
   
   The `Spawn` trait is used to spawn a future onto the runtime. The implementation for `Handle` allows the user to spawn a task using the `spawn_task` method.
