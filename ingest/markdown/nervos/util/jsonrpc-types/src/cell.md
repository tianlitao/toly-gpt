The code defines three structs: `CellWithStatus`, `CellInfo`, and `CellData`. These structs are used to represent a cell in the CKB blockchain. A cell is a container in which data can be stored on the blockchain. The `CellWithStatus` struct contains a `CellInfo` struct and a string representing the status of the cell. The `CellInfo` struct contains a `CellOutput` struct and an optional `CellData` struct. The `CellData` struct contains the content of the cell and its hash.

The `From` trait is implemented for `CellMeta` and `CellStatus` to convert them into `CellInfo` and `CellWithStatus` respectively. `CellMeta` is a struct that contains metadata about a cell, such as its output and data. `CellStatus` is an enum that represents the status of a cell, which can be live, dead, or unknown.

The purpose of this code is to provide a JSON view of a cell with its status information. This can be used in the larger project to allow users to query information about cells on the blockchain. For example, a user could use this code to retrieve information about a specific cell, such as its content and status. The JSON view can be returned to the user as a response to their query.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `CellWithStatus` struct and how is it used?
- The `CellWithStatus` struct is a JSON view of a cell with its status information, and it is used to represent the status of a cell in the CKB blockchain. It contains a `cell` field that holds the cell information and a `status` field that indicates the status of the cell.

2. What is the difference between the `CellInfo` and `CellData` structs?
- The `CellInfo` struct is a JSON view of a cell that combines the fields in cell output and cell data, while the `CellData` struct contains only the cell data content and hash. The `CellInfo` struct is used to represent the information of a cell in the CKB blockchain, while the `CellData` struct is used to represent the content and hash of the cell data.

3. What is the purpose of the `From` implementations for `CellMeta` and `CellStatus`?
- The `From` implementations for `CellMeta` and `CellStatus` are used to convert a `CellMeta` or `CellStatus` object into a `CellInfo` or `CellWithStatus` object, respectively. This allows for easy conversion between different representations of cell information and status in the CKB blockchain.
