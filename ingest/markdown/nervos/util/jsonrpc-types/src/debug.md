The code defines two structs, `ExtraLoggerConfig` and `MainLoggerConfig`, which are used to configure the runtime logger for the ckb project. The `ExtraLoggerConfig` struct allows for setting log levels for different modules, while the `MainLoggerConfig` struct provides additional options for configuring the logger.

The `ExtraLoggerConfig` struct has a single field, `filter`, which is a string that sets the log levels for different modules. The string can be formatted in different ways to specify the log levels for different modules. For example, setting the log level to info for all modules can be done by setting the `filter` field to `info`. On the other hand, setting the log level to debug for specific modules and info for other modules can be done by setting the `filter` field to a comma-separated list of module names and their corresponding log levels, like so: `info,ckb-rpc=debug,ckb-sync=debug,ckb-relay=debug,ckb-tx-pool=debug,ckb-network=debug`.

The `MainLoggerConfig` struct has four fields: `filter`, `to_stdout`, `to_file`, and `color`. The `filter` field is similar to the one in `ExtraLoggerConfig`, but it is optional and can be set to `null` to keep the current option unchanged. The `to_stdout` field is a boolean that determines whether the logs should be printed to the process stdout. It is also optional and can be set to `null` to keep the current option unchanged. The `to_file` field is a boolean that determines whether the logs should be appended to a log file. Like the other fields, it is optional and can be set to `null` to keep the current option unchanged. Finally, the `color` field is a boolean that determines whether color should be used when printing the logs to the process stdout. It is also optional and can be set to `null` to keep the current option unchanged.

Overall, these structs provide a flexible way to configure the runtime logger for the ckb project, allowing developers to set log levels for different modules and customize how the logs are outputted. This can be useful for debugging and monitoring the project during development and deployment.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `ExtraLoggerConfig` struct?
- The `ExtraLoggerConfig` struct is used to configure extra loggers for the runtime logger.

2. What is the difference between the `filter` field in `ExtraLoggerConfig` and `MainLoggerConfig`?
- The `filter` field in `ExtraLoggerConfig` sets log levels for different modules for extra loggers, while the `filter` field in `MainLoggerConfig` sets log levels for different modules for the main logger.

3. What are the optional fields in `MainLoggerConfig` used for?
- The `to_stdout` field is used to determine whether to print logs to the process stdout, the `to_file` field is used to determine whether to append logs to the log file, and the `color` field is used to determine whether to use color when printing logs to the process stdout. All of these fields are optional and can be set to null to keep the current option unchanged.
