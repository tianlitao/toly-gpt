The code defines several structs that represent different aspects of the CKB (Nervos Network) node's P2P network. The `LocalNode` struct represents information about the local node, including its version, node ID, whether it is active, its P2P addresses, supported protocols, and number of connections. The `RemoteNode` struct represents information about a remote node that has connected to the local node, including its version, node ID, addresses, whether it is outbound, elapsed time since connection, elapsed time since receiving a ping response, synchronization state, and active protocols. The `PeerSyncState` struct represents the chain synchronization state between the local node and a remote node, including the best known header hash and number, last common header hash and number, unknown header list size, inflight count, and can fetch count. The `NodeAddress` struct represents a P2P address and its score, while the `BannedAddr` struct represents a banned P2P address and the reason for the ban. Finally, the `SyncState` struct represents the overall chain synchronization state of the local node, including whether it is in IBD, the best known block number and timestamp, orphan blocks count, inflight blocks count, and download scheduler's time analysis data.

These structs can be used to gather information about the local node and its connections to other nodes in the P2P network, as well as to manage banned addresses and monitor the synchronization state of the chain. For example, the `LocalNode` struct can be used to retrieve information about the local node's version and number of connections, while the `RemoteNode` struct can be used to retrieve information about a specific remote node's version and synchronization state. The `PeerSyncState` struct can be used to monitor the synchronization progress between the local node and a remote node, while the `SyncState` struct can be used to monitor the overall synchronization progress of the local node. The `BannedAddr` struct can be used to manage banned addresses and the reasons for their bans.

Overall, these structs provide a way to gather and manage information about the CKB node's P2P network, which is an important aspect of the node's functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LocalNode` struct and what information does it contain?
- The `LocalNode` struct contains information about the node itself, such as its version, node ID, active status, P2P addresses, supported protocols, and number of connections. Its purpose is to provide a way for the node to share information about itself with other nodes on the network.

2. What is the difference between the `RemoteNode` and `LocalNode` structs?
- The `RemoteNode` struct contains information about a remote node that has connected to the local node via the P2P network, while the `LocalNode` struct contains information about the local node itself. The `RemoteNode` struct includes information such as the remote node's version, ID, addresses, connection status, and synchronization state, while the `LocalNode` struct does not include information about other nodes.

3. What is the purpose of the `SyncState` struct and what information does it contain?
- The `SyncState` struct contains information about the overall chain synchronization state of the local node, including whether the node is in IBD, the best known block number and timestamp, the number of orphan blocks and inflight blocks, and download scheduler time analysis data. Its purpose is to provide a way for the node to monitor its synchronization progress and identify any issues that may be affecting block download.
