This file contains several structs and enums that are used to represent information related to softfork deployments and chain information in the ckb project.

The `DeploymentPos` enum represents the possible deployment positions, with two options: `Testdummy` and `LightClient`.

The `DeploymentState` enum represents the possible states of a softfork deployment, with five options: `Defined`, `Started`, `LockedIn`, `Active`, and `Failed`. Each state represents a different stage in the softfork deployment process, from the initial definition to the final outcome.

The `DeploymentsInfo` struct contains information about softfork deployments, including the requested block hash and epoch, as well as a `BTreeMap` of `DeploymentPos` keys and `DeploymentInfo` values.

The `DeploymentInfo` struct contains information about a specific softfork deployment, including the bit used to signal the softfork lock-in and activation, the start epoch, timeout epoch, minimum activation epoch, and deployment state.

The `ChainInfo` struct contains information about the chain, including the network name, median time of the last 37 blocks, epoch information of the tip block, current difficulty, whether the local node is in IBD, and active alerts stored in the local node.

These structs and enums are used throughout the ckb project to represent and manipulate softfork deployment and chain information. For example, the `DeploymentsInfo` struct may be used to retrieve information about softfork deployments at a specific block, while the `ChainInfo` struct may be used to retrieve information about the current state of the chain.

Overall, this file provides a foundation for working with softfork deployments and chain information in the ckb project.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `DeploymentPos` enum and what are its possible values?
- The `DeploymentPos` enum is used to represent the name of a softfork deployment.
- Its possible values are `Testdummy` and `LightClient`.

2. What information does the `DeploymentInfo` struct contain and what is its purpose?
- The `DeploymentInfo` struct contains information about a specific softfork deployment, such as the bit used to signal the softfork lock-in and activation, the start epoch, timeout epoch, minimum activation epoch, and deployment state.
- Its purpose is to provide state information regarding deployments of consensus changes.

3. What is the purpose of the `ChainInfo` struct and what information does it contain?
- The `ChainInfo` struct contains information about the current state of the blockchain, such as the network name, median time of the last 37 blocks, epoch information of the tip block, current difficulty, whether the local node is in IBD, and active alerts stored in the local node.
- Its purpose is to provide chain information to the user or developer.
