The `BlockTemplate` struct represents a block template for miners to use when assembling a new block. It contains various fields that miners must use unchanged in the assembled block, such as the block version, compacted difficulty target, timestamp, block number, epoch progress information, parent block hash, cycles limit, block serialized size limit, uncle count limit, and more. 

The `BlockTemplate` struct also contains other fields that miners can modify, such as the current time, which they can increase to the current time, and the uncles and transactions, which they can select from the provided valid candidates. The `BlockTemplate` struct also includes a cellbase transaction template, which miners must use as the cellbase transaction without changes in the assembled block.

The `BlockTemplate` struct also includes a `work_id` field, which the miner must submit the new assembled and resolved block using the same work ID. Additionally, there is a `dao` field, which is only valid when miners use all and only use the provided transactions in the template. Two fields must be updated when miners want to select transactions.

The `BlockTemplate` struct also includes an optional `extension` field, which is a reserved field that miners should leave blank. 

The `BlockTemplate` struct has an implementation of the `From` trait for the `packed::Block` struct, which converts a `BlockTemplate` into a `packed::Block`. 

The `UncleTemplate` struct represents an uncle block template of the new block for miners. It contains fields such as the uncle block hash, whether miners must include this uncle in the submit block, the proposals of the uncle block, and the header of the uncle block. The `UncleTemplate` struct has an implementation of the `From` trait for the `packed::UncleBlock` struct, which converts an `UncleTemplate` into a `packed::UncleBlock`.

The `CellbaseTemplate` struct represents the cellbase transaction template of the new block for miners. It contains fields such as the cellbase transaction hash, the hint of how many cycles this transaction consumes, and the cellbase transaction. The `CellbaseTemplate` struct has an implementation of the `From` trait for the `packed::Transaction` struct, which converts a `CellbaseTemplate` into a `packed::Transaction`.

The `TransactionTemplate` struct represents a transaction template that is ready to be committed in the new block. It contains fields such as the transaction hash, whether the miner must include this transaction in the new block, the hint of how many cycles this transaction consumes, transaction dependencies, and the transaction itself. The `TransactionTemplate` struct has an implementation of the `From` trait for the `packed::Transaction` struct, which converts a `TransactionTemplate` into a `packed::Transaction`. 

Overall, the `BlockTemplate` struct and its related structs provide a way for miners to assemble a new block using provided templates and candidates while ensuring that certain fields remain unchanged.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BlockTemplate` struct?
- The `BlockTemplate` struct represents a block template for miners, which includes various information such as the block version, difficulty target, timestamp, block number, and provided transactions and uncle blocks.

2. What is the `cycles_limit` field used for?
- The `cycles_limit` field specifies the maximum number of cycles that can be used in the block. Miners must ensure that the total cycles used in the block do not exceed this limit, otherwise the block submission will be rejected by the CKB node.

3. What is the purpose of the `CellbaseTemplate` struct?
- The `CellbaseTemplate` struct represents the cellbase transaction template for the new block, which includes information such as the transaction hash, consumed cycles, and the transaction data. Miners must use this transaction as the cellbase transaction without changes in the assembled block.
