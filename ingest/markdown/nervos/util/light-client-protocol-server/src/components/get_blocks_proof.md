The `GetBlocksProofProcess` struct and its associated implementation provide functionality for processing a `GetBlocksProof` message received by a CKB light client. The purpose of this code is to handle requests for block headers from a remote peer, and to return a proof of the requested headers to the peer.

The `GetBlocksProofProcess` struct contains four fields: `message`, which is a reader for the `GetBlocksProof` message; `protocol`, which is a reference to the `LightClientProtocol`; `peer`, which is the index of the peer that sent the message; and `nc`, which is a reference to the `CKBProtocolContext`.

The `new` function creates a new `GetBlocksProofProcess` instance with the given parameters.

The `execute` function processes the `GetBlocksProof` message. It first checks that the message contains at least one block hash, and that the number of block hashes is not greater than a predefined limit. If either of these conditions is not met, an error is returned.

Next, the function retrieves the active chain from the `LightClientProtocol`, and gets the last block hash and block from the message. If the last block is not found in the active chain, a reply is sent to the peer with the current tip state.

The function then checks that there are no duplicate block hashes in the message, and creates a `HashSet` to store the block hashes. It then iterates over the block hashes, and for each hash, retrieves the corresponding block header from the active chain. If the header is found and is not the same as the last block, its position is added to a vector of positions, and the header is added to a vector of block headers. If the header is not found or is the same as the last block, the hash is added to a vector of missing blocks.

Finally, the function packs the block headers and missing blocks into `packed` types, and sends a proof of the requested headers to the peer using the `reply_proof` function of the `LightClientProtocol`.

Overall, this code provides an important piece of functionality for the CKB light client, allowing it to request and receive block headers from remote peers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a part of the `ckb` project and implements the `GetBlocksProofProcess` struct, which is responsible for processing incoming `GetBlocksProof` messages from peers in the CKB network.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   
   This code depends on several external crates, including `std::collections::HashSet`, `ckb_merkle_mountain_range`, `ckb_network`, and `ckb_types`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `execute` function?
   
   The `execute` function takes no input and returns a `Status` enum value. It performs several checks on the incoming `GetBlocksProof` message, retrieves block headers from the active chain, and constructs a response message to send back to the peer. The `Status` value returned indicates whether the processing was successful or not.
