The `GetLastStateProofProcess` struct and `FindBlocksViaDifficulties` trait are part of the ckb project and are used in the implementation of the light client protocol. The purpose of this code is to provide a proof of the current state of the blockchain to a light client. 

The `GetLastStateProofProcess` struct contains the message received from the light client requesting the proof, as well as the necessary context to generate the proof. The `execute` method of this struct is called to generate the proof and send it back to the light client. 

The `FindBlocksViaDifficulties` trait provides methods to find blocks based on their difficulty. The `BlockSampler` struct implements this trait and is used to sample blocks from the blockchain based on their difficulty. 

The `execute` method of `GetLastStateProofProcess` first checks the validity of the request, including the number of samples requested and the difficulty boundary. It then uses the `BlockSampler` to sample blocks from the blockchain based on their difficulty, and generates a proof of the state of the blockchain using the sampled blocks. The proof is then sent back to the light client. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the ckb project as it allows light clients to verify the state of the blockchain without having to download the entire blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FindBlocksViaDifficulties` trait and how is it used in the code?
- The `FindBlocksViaDifficulties` trait defines methods for finding block numbers based on their total difficulties. It is used by the `BlockSampler` struct to sample blocks based on their difficulties.

2. What is the purpose of the `GetLastStateProofProcess` struct and what does its `execute` method do?
- The `GetLastStateProofProcess` struct represents a process for handling a `GetLastStateProof` message in the light client protocol. Its `execute` method executes the process by sampling blocks based on their difficulties, generating headers for the sampled blocks, and replying with a proof of the last state.

3. What is the purpose of the `BlockSampler` struct and how is it used in the code?
- The `BlockSampler` struct implements the `FindBlocksViaDifficulties` trait and provides methods for sampling blocks based on their difficulties. It is used by the `GetLastStateProofProcess` struct to sample blocks and generate headers for the sampled blocks.
