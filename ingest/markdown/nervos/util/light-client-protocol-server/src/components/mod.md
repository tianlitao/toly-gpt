This code is a module that provides access to different processes related to obtaining proofs for various data in the ckb project. The module includes four sub-modules: `get_blocks_proof`, `get_last_state`, `get_last_state_proof`, and `get_transactions_proof`. Each of these sub-modules contains a process for obtaining a specific type of proof.

The `pub(crate)` keyword is used to make the processes available within the crate, but not outside of it. This means that other modules within the ckb project can access these processes, but external modules cannot.

The purpose of this module is to provide a centralized location for accessing proof processes, which can be used throughout the larger ckb project. For example, if another module needs to obtain a proof of a block, it can import the `GetBlocksProofProcess` from this module and use it to obtain the proof.

Here is an example of how one of the processes in this module might be used:

```
use ckb::get_blocks_proof::GetBlocksProofProcess;

let block_number = 100;
let proof_process = GetBlocksProofProcess::new();
let proof = proof_process.get_proof(block_number);
```

In this example, we first import the `GetBlocksProofProcess` from the `ckb` crate. We then create a new instance of the process using the `new()` method. Finally, we use the `get_proof()` method to obtain a proof for the block at height 100.

Overall, this module provides a convenient way to access proof processes within the ckb project, making it easier for other modules to obtain the data they need.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this module and what does it do?
   - This module appears to be related to proof processing for various types of data, including blocks, state, and transactions. However, without further context it is unclear what specific functionality is provided by each process.

2. What is the significance of the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute above the `tests` module?
   - The `#[cfg(test)]` attribute indicates that the `tests` module is only compiled when running tests, and is not included in the final binary. This is a common convention in Rust projects to separate test code from production code.

3. Why are the four processes being re-exported as `pub(crate)`?
   - The `pub(crate)` visibility modifier allows the processes to be accessed within the same crate (i.e. module) but not outside of it. This suggests that these processes are intended for internal use within the `ckb` project, but not for use by external code.
