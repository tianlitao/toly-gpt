This code defines a set of status codes and a `Status` struct that represents a status with a code and an optional context. The status codes are represented by an enum called `StatusCode`, which is a 16-bit unsigned integer. The first digit of the status code defines the class of result, with the following classes defined:

- 1xx: Informational response â€“ the request was received, continuing process.
- 2xx: Success - The action requested by the client was received, understood, and accepted.
- 4xx: Client errors - The error seems to have been caused by the client.
- 5xx: Server errors - The server failed to fulfil a request.

The `StatusCode` enum also defines several specific status codes, such as `OK`, `MalformedProtocolMessage`, `InvalidRequest`, and `InternalError`. Each status code has a corresponding integer value.

The `Status` struct has two fields: a `StatusCode` and an optional `String` context. It implements the `PartialEq` and `fmt::Display` traits. The `PartialEq` implementation compares the `StatusCode` fields of two `Status` instances. The `fmt::Display` implementation formats the `Status` as a string, including the code and context if present.

The `Status` struct also defines several methods. The `new` method creates a new `Status` instance with a given `StatusCode` and optional context. The `ok` method returns a `Status` instance with an `OK` code and no context. The `is_ok` method returns true if the `StatusCode` is `OK`. The `should_ban` method returns an optional `Duration` if the `StatusCode` is in the `400..500` range, indicating that the session should be banned. The `should_warn` method returns true if the `StatusCode` is in the `500..600` range, indicating that a warning log should be output. The `code` method returns the `StatusCode` of the `Status`.

This code is used to represent the status of various operations in the larger project. For example, a network request may return a `Status` indicating whether the request was successful or not, and if not, what went wrong. The `StatusCode` enum provides a standardized set of codes that can be used throughout the project to indicate the result of an operation. The `Status` struct provides a way to encapsulate a status code and an optional context, which can be useful for providing additional information about an error or warning.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `StatusCode` enum and how is it used?
- The `StatusCode` enum is used to indicate whether a specific operation has been successfully completed. It is a 3-digit integer that defines the class of result, and is used to create a `Status` struct that contains a code and an optional context.

2. What is the difference between `InvalidLastBlock` and `InvalidUnconfirmedBlock`?
- `InvalidLastBlock` refers to the last block sent from the client being invalid, while `InvalidUnconfirmedBlock` refers to at least one unconfirmed block sent from the client being invalid.

3. What is the purpose of the `should_ban` method in the `Status` struct?
- The `should_ban` method is used to determine whether the session should be banned based on the status code. If the code is within the range of 400-499, it returns a `Duration` that represents the amount of time the session should be banned for. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
