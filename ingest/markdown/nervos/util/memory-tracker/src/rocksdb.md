The code defines a trait `TrackRocksDBMemory` and two implementations of it. The trait is used to track the memory usage of RocksDB, a high-performance embedded database engine. The first implementation, `DummyRocksDB`, is a dummy struct that does nothing when the trait methods are called. The second implementation is generic over a type `RocksDB` that must implement three traits: `GetColumnFamilys`, `GetProperty`, and `GetPropertyCF`. It overrides the `gather_int_values` method of the trait to gather integer values through `ckb-metrics`, a metrics library used in the larger project.

The `gather_memory_stats` method of the trait calls `gather_int_values` with several keys that correspond to different memory statistics of RocksDB. For each column family of the database, the method calls `property_int_value_cf` with the key and converts the result to a `PropertyValue<u64>`. If the result is an error, it is converted to an `Error` variant of the enum. If it is `None`, it is converted to a `Null` variant. Otherwise, it is converted to a `Value` variant. The method then sets the value of a metric in `ckb-metrics` with the integer value of the `PropertyValue` using the column family name and the key as labels.

This code is used to monitor the memory usage of RocksDB in the larger project. It provides a way to gather memory statistics and expose them as metrics that can be visualized and analyzed. The `TrackRocksDBMemory` trait can be implemented by any type that uses RocksDB as its database engine, allowing the memory usage of different components of the project to be tracked separately. For example, a blockchain node and a wallet application may use different column families and have different memory usage patterns. By using `ckb-metrics`, the memory usage of RocksDB can be monitored in real-time and alerts can be triggered if it exceeds certain thresholds.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PropertyValue` enum and its implementations?
- The `PropertyValue` enum is used to represent the result of a database query, and can contain either a value of type `T`, a null value, or an error message. The implementations provide methods for converting the enum to an `i64` or from a `Result<Option<T>, String>`.

2. What is the `TrackRocksDBMemory` trait used for?
- The `TrackRocksDBMemory` trait is used to gather memory statistics for a RocksDB database using the `ckb-metrics` library. It defines two methods for gathering memory statistics and integer values.

3. What is the purpose of the `DummyRocksDB` struct?
- The `DummyRocksDB` struct is a placeholder implementation of the `TrackRocksDBMemory` trait that does nothing. It is used as a default implementation for types that do not implement the trait.
