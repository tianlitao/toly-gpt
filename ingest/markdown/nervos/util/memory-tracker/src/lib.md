The code is responsible for tracking the memory usage of the CKB (Nervos Network) process and Jemalloc. The code is divided into three modules: jemalloc, process, and rocksdb.

The jemalloc module is responsible for enabling Jemalloc profiling, which is disabled by default. The `jemalloc_profiling_dump` function is a dummy function that is used when Jemalloc profiling is not supported. It returns an error message indicating that Jemalloc profiling is not supported.

The process module is responsible for tracking the memory usage of the CKB process. The `track_current_process` function is a dummy function that is used when tracking memory usage is not supported. It logs an info message indicating that tracking the current process is not supported.

The rocksdb module is responsible for tracking the memory usage of RocksDB, which is a persistent key-value store used by CKB. The `TrackRocksDBMemory` trait is defined in this module, which is implemented by the `DummyRocksDB` struct.

The `track_current_process_simple` function is responsible for tracking the memory usage of the CKB process and Jemalloc. It calls the `track_current_process` function with the `DummyRocksDB` struct and a `None` value for the `Tracker` parameter.

Overall, this code is used to track the memory usage of the CKB process and its dependencies. It can be used to diagnose memory leaks and optimize memory usage. The `track_current_process_simple` function can be called periodically to track memory usage over time.

Example usage:

```
use ckb::memory_tracker::track_current_process_simple;

// Track memory usage every 10 seconds
track_current_process_simple(10);
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code?

   This code is used to track the memory usage of the CKB process and Jemalloc.

2. What is the significance of the `feature = "profiling"` attribute?

   The `feature = "profiling"` attribute is used to enable Jemalloc profiling, which is disabled by default.

3. What is the purpose of the `DummyRocksDB` struct?

   The `DummyRocksDB` struct is used as a placeholder for the `Tracker` type parameter in the `track_current_process` function when tracking memory usage isn't supported.
