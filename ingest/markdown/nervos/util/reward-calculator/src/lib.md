The code in this file implements a block reward calculator for the ckb project. The `RewardCalculator` struct is used to calculate the total block reward for a given block. The block reward is divided into four parts: primary block reward, secondary block reward, proposals reward, and transaction fees. 

The `RewardCalculator` struct has three methods: `new`, `block_reward_to_finalize`, and `block_reward_for_target`. The `new` method creates a new instance of the `RewardCalculator` struct. The `block_reward_to_finalize` method takes a `parent` block header as input and returns the target block miner's lock and total block reward. The `block_reward_for_target` method takes a `target` block header as input and returns the target block miner's lock and total block reward. 

The `block_reward_internal` method is used internally by both `block_reward_to_finalize` and `block_reward_for_target` to calculate the target block miner's lock and total block reward. This method calculates the transaction fees, proposal reward, primary block reward, secondary block reward, and total reward for the target block. 

The `txs_fees` method calculates the transaction fees for the target block. The `proposal_reward` method calculates the proposal reward for the target block. The `base_block_reward` method calculates the primary and secondary block rewards for the target block. The `get_proposal_ids_by_hash` method is used to get the proposal IDs for a given block hash. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the ckb project as it calculates the block reward for each block. This information is important for miners who are incentivized to mine blocks and earn rewards.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code implements a ckb block reward calculator.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `block_reward_to_finalize` function?
- The input is a `HeaderView` representing the parent block, and the output is a tuple containing the target block miner's lock and total block reward.

3. What are the four parts that make up the target block's total reward?
- The four parts are primary block reward, secondary block reward, proposals reward, and transactions fees.
