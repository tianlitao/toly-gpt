The `capacity_bytes` function in this code is a procedural macro that takes an integer literal as input and returns a `Capacity` struct from the `ckb_occupied_capacity_core` crate. The purpose of this macro is to convert a given number of bytes into a `Capacity` value that can be used in the larger project.

The `Capacity` struct represents the capacity of a cell in the CKB blockchain. It is used to calculate the occupied capacity of a cell, which is the amount of space it takes up on the blockchain. The `Capacity` struct has a `shannons` field that represents the capacity in shannons, the smallest unit of currency in the CKB blockchain.

The `capacity_bytes` macro takes an integer literal as input, which represents the number of bytes to be converted into a `Capacity` value. If the input is a positive integer literal without any suffix, the macro converts it into a `Capacity` value and returns it as a `shannons` field in a `quote!` macro. If the input is not a positive integer literal without any suffix, the macro returns a compile error.

Here is an example of how this macro can be used in the larger project:

```rust
use ckb::occupied_capacity::Capacity;
use ckb_macro::capacity_bytes;

fn main() {
    let bytes = 1024;
    let capacity = capacity_bytes!(bytes);
    let occupied_capacity = Capacity::bytes(bytes).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(capacity.shannons(), occupied_capacity.shannons());
}
```

In this example, we use the `capacity_bytes` macro to convert `1024` bytes into a `Capacity` value. We then calculate the occupied capacity of a cell with `1024` bytes using the `Capacity::bytes` method from the `ckb_occupied_capacity_core` crate. Finally, we compare the `shannons` fields of the two `Capacity` values to ensure that they are equal.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   
   This code defines a procedural macro called `capacity_bytes` that takes an integer literal as input and returns a `Capacity` struct. The `Capacity` struct is defined in the `ckb_occupied_capacity_core` crate and represents the capacity of a cell in a blockchain.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   
   This code depends on the `proc_macro`, `quote`, and `syn` crates. It also depends on the `ckb_occupied_capacity_core` crate.

3. Who is responsible for maintaining this code and how can they be contacted?
   
   The code contains two `TODO` comments that mention `@keroro520`. It is likely that this person is responsible for maintaining the code. However, there is no information provided on how to contact them.
