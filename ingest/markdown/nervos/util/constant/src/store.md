The code snippet defines a constant value called `TX_INDEX_UPPER_BOUND` which is used to set the upper bound of the transaction key range in the ckb project. The purpose of this value is to optimize the performance of the database iteration process by setting the transaction key range as tight as possible. This ensures that the database iteration process stops sooner, rather than walking over the whole range of tombstones, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

The value of `TX_INDEX_UPPER_BOUND` is calculated by dividing 597,000 by the empty transaction size of 72 bytes. This results in a value of approximately 8291, which is then rounded down to 8290 and stored as the constant value.

In practical terms, this constant value is used in various parts of the ckb project where transaction indexing is required. For example, it may be used in the implementation of the transaction pool, where transactions are stored and indexed for efficient retrieval and validation. By setting the upper bound of the transaction key range to a tight value, the transaction pool can operate more efficiently and with less resource usage.

Overall, the `TX_INDEX_UPPER_BOUND` constant value plays an important role in optimizing the performance of the ckb project's database iteration process, particularly in the context of transaction indexing.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `TX_INDEX_UPPER_BOUND` constant?

   The `TX_INDEX_UPPER_BOUND` constant is used to set the upper bound of the transaction key range in order to optimize database iteration and avoid unnecessary processing.

2. How was the value of `597 * 1000 / 72` determined for `TX_INDEX_UPPER_BOUND`?

   The value of `597 * 1000 / 72` was calculated based on the assumption that an empty transaction has a size of 72 bytes, and the desired key range should be as tight as possible to minimize unnecessary iteration.

3. What is the significance of the comment preceding the `TX_INDEX_UPPER_BOUND` constant?

   The comment preceding the `TX_INDEX_UPPER_BOUND` constant provides context and explanation for the purpose and value of the constant, which can help other developers understand and modify the code more easily.
