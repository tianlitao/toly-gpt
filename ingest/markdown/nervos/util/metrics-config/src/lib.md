[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/develop/util/metrics-config/src/lib.rs)

The code is a Rust crate used to configure the CKB metrics service. The purpose of this crate is to provide a way to configure the metrics service by defining exporters and their configurations.

The crate contains three structs: `Config`, `Exporter`, and `Target`. The `Config` struct is the main configuration struct that stores all the exporters' configurations. The `Exporter` struct defines the configuration of an exporter, and the `Target` struct defines how to output the metrics data.

The `Config` struct has a `HashMap` field named `exporter` that stores all the exporters' configurations. The `Exporter` struct has a `target` field that defines how to output the metrics data. The `Target` struct is an enum that has only one variant named `Prometheus`, which outputs the metrics data through Prometheus. The `Prometheus` variant has a field named `listen_address` that defines the HTTP listen address.

The crate provides an example of how to use it in the `ckb.toml` file. The example shows how to configure the Prometheus exporter by defining its type and listen address.

Overall, this crate provides a simple and flexible way to configure the CKB metrics service. It allows users to define multiple exporters and their configurations, making it easy to customize the metrics service to fit their needs.
## Questions:
