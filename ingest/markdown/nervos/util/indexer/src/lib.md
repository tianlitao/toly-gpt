The code above is a module that contains the built-in indexer for the ckb project. The indexer is responsible for indexing data related to transactions and blocks in the blockchain. This module creates secondary database instances that share data with the ckb node. 

The `error` module contains error types that may occur during the indexing process. The `indexer` module contains the implementation of the indexer itself, which is responsible for indexing transactions and blocks. The `pool` module contains a transaction pool that is used by the indexer to keep track of unconfirmed transactions. The `store` module contains the implementation of the database used by the indexer to store indexed data.

The `service` module contains the public interface for the indexer service. It exports two items: `IndexerHandle` and `IndexerService`. The `IndexerHandle` is a handle to the indexer service that can be used to interact with it. The `IndexerService` is the actual implementation of the indexer service.

Developers can use the indexer service to query indexed data from the blockchain. For example, they can use it to retrieve information about a specific transaction or block. The indexer service can also be used to monitor the blockchain for new transactions and blocks as they are added.

Here is an example of how the `IndexerHandle` can be used to query indexed data:

```rust
use ckb_indexer::service::IndexerHandle;

let indexer_handle = IndexerHandle::new();
let block_hash = "0x1234567890abcdef".parse().unwrap();
let block_info = indexer_handle.get_block_info(block_hash).unwrap();
println!("Block number: {}", block_info.number);
```

In this example, we create a new `IndexerHandle` and use it to retrieve information about a block with the given hash. We then print the block number to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ckb` project's built-in indexer?
   - The built-in indexer is used to share data with the ckb node by creating secondary db instances.
   
2. What are the different modules included in the `ckb` project's indexer?
   - The `ckb` project's indexer includes four modules: `error`, `indexer`, `pool`, and `store`.
   
3. What is included in the `service` module of the `ckb` project's indexer?
   - The `service` module includes the `IndexerHandle` and `IndexerService` structs, which are used to provide the indexer service.
