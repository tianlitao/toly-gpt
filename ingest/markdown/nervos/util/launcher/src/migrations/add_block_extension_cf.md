This code is a migration script for the ckb project's database. Specifically, it adds a new column family to the RocksDB instance used by the project. 

A column family is a way to group related data together within a database. In this case, the new column family is called "BlockExtension". The purpose of this column family is not specified in this code, but it is likely related to storing additional data associated with blocks in the blockchain. 

The `AddBlockExtensionColumnFamily` struct is defined to implement the `Migration` trait, which is used by the ckb_db_migration library to manage database migrations. The `migrate` function is called when this migration is run, and it takes in a `RocksDB` instance and a progress bar function. In this case, the function simply returns the same `RocksDB` instance that was passed in, indicating that no changes need to be made to the database. 

The `version` function returns a string representing the version of this migration. This is used by the migration manager to keep track of which migrations have already been run. The `expensive` function returns a boolean indicating whether this migration is expensive to run. In this case, it returns `false`, indicating that it is not expensive. 

Overall, this code is a small piece of the larger ckb project's database management system. It adds a new column family to the database, which is likely used to store additional data associated with blocks in the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a migration for adding a new column family to a RocksDB database used in the ckb project.

2. What is the significance of the `AddBlockExtensionColumnFamily` struct?
   The `AddBlockExtensionColumnFamily` struct represents the migration that adds the new column family to the database.

3. What is the purpose of the `expensive` function in the `Migration` trait?
   The `expensive` function is used to indicate whether the migration is expensive and should be run asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread. In this case, it returns `false`, indicating that the migration is not expensive.
