The code is a migration script for the ckb project's database. Specifically, it is responsible for migrating the cell data in the database to a new format. The migration is performed by the `CellMigration` struct, which implements the `Migration` trait. The `migrate` method of the `CellMigration` struct takes a `RocksDB` instance and a progress bar as input, and returns a `Result<RocksDB, Error>`.

The migration process involves cleaning the `COLUMN_CELL` column family of the database, inserting new live cells, and deleting consumed cells. The `clean_cell_column` function drops the `COLUMN_CELL` column family and creates a new one. The `insert_block_cell` function inserts new live cells into the database. It takes a `StoreWriteBatch` and a `BlockView` as input, and extracts the cell data from the block to insert into the database. The `delete_consumed_cell` function deletes consumed cells from the database. It takes a `StoreWriteBatch` and a slice of `TransactionView` as input, and extracts the input points from the transactions to delete from the database.

The migration process is performed using the `multi_thread_migration` macro, which spawns multiple threads to perform the migration in parallel. The macro takes a closure as input, which contains the migration logic. The closure is executed in parallel across multiple threads, with each thread processing a chunk of the data. The size of the chunks is determined by the `chunk_size` variable.

The `CellMigration` struct also defines a version number for the migration, which is used to track the version of the database schema. The version number is defined as a constant `RESTORE_CELL_VERSION`.

Overall, this code is an important part of the ckb project's database migration process. It is used to migrate the cell data in the database to a new format, and is executed in parallel across multiple threads to improve performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains a migration implementation for cleaning and restoring a cell column in a RocksDB database.

2. What is the significance of the `RESTORE_CELL_VERSION` constant?
- The `RESTORE_CELL_VERSION` constant is used to identify the version of the migration and ensure that it is only applied once to the database.

3. What is the purpose of the `multi_thread_migration` macro and how is it used in this code?
- The `multi_thread_migration` macro is used to parallelize the migration process across multiple threads. It is used to wrap a block of code that inserts new cells and deletes consumed cells from the database.
