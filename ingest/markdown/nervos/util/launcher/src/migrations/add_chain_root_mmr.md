The code defines a migration for adding a Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) to the ChainDB of the ckb project. MMR is a data structure used to store and verify the integrity of a large set of data, such as the blockchain. The purpose of this migration is to create an MMR of the block headers in the ChainDB and store it in the database for future use.

The migration is implemented as a struct `AddChainRootMMR` that implements the `Migration` trait. The `migrate` method takes a RocksDB instance and a progress bar as input, and returns a RocksDB instance as output. The method first creates a `ChainDB` instance using the input RocksDB and the default store configuration. It then retrieves the tip header of the blockchain from the ChainDB and gets its block number. A progress bar is created to show the progress of the migration.

The method then enters a loop that iterates over the block headers in the ChainDB in batches of 10,000. For each batch, it creates a new MMR instance with the current MMR size and the current RocksDB transaction. It then iterates over the block headers in the batch, retrieves their digests, and pushes them to the MMR. The progress bar is updated for each block header processed. After the batch is processed, the MMR size is updated and the MMR is committed to the RocksDB transaction. If all block headers have been processed, the loop exits.

Finally, the progress bar is finished and the modified RocksDB instance is returned. The `version` method returns a constant string representing the version of the migration.

This migration can be used to add an MMR to the ChainDB of the ckb project, which can be used for various purposes such as verifying the integrity of the blockchain data. The migration can be executed using the `ckb-db-migrate` command-line tool provided by the `ckb-db-migration` crate. For example:

```
ckb-db-migrate --db rocksdb://path/to/rocksdb --to 20221208151540
```

This command migrates the RocksDB instance located at `path/to/rocksdb` to the version `20221208151540` using the `AddChainRootMMR` migration.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a migration script that adds a Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) of chain roots to the database for the ckb blockchain.

2. What dependencies does this code use?
   
   This code uses several dependencies, including `ckb_app_config`, `ckb_db`, `ckb_db_migration`, `ckb_error`, `ckb_store`, and `ckb_types`.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
   
   The expected output of this code is an updated RocksDB database with a new MMR of chain roots for the ckb blockchain. The progress of the migration is displayed using a progress bar.
