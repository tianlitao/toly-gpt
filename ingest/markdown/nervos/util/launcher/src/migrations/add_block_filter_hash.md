The code defines a migration for adding block filter hashes to a RocksDB database used by the ckb project. The migration is implemented as a struct called `AddBlockFilterHash` that implements the `Migration` trait. The `migrate` method of the trait is implemented to perform the actual migration.

The migration first creates a `ChainDB` instance using the provided `RocksDB` instance and default `StoreConfig`. It then checks if there is a latest built filter data block hash in the database. If there is, it retrieves the block number of the latest built filter data block and calculates the parent block filter hash for each block from the next block number up to the latest built filter data block number. It does this in batches of 10,000 blocks at a time, committing the changes to the database after each batch. The progress of the migration is displayed using a progress bar.

The purpose of this migration is to add block filter hashes to the database, which are used to filter transactions for a given block. This is an important feature for the ckb project, as it allows for efficient transaction filtering and improves the performance of the system. The migration is intended to be run once during the setup of the database and is not expected to be run frequently.

Example usage of the migration:

```rust
use ckb_db::RocksDB;
use ckb_db_migration::{Migration, ProgressBar, ProgressStyle};
use ckb_types::prelude::Entity;
use std::sync::Arc;

let db = RocksDB::open_tmp(Default::default()).unwrap();
let pb = Arc::new(|_| ProgressBar::new(100));
let migration = AddBlockFilterHash;
migration.migrate(db, pb).unwrap();
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code?

   This code is a migration script that adds block filter hashes to the RocksDB database used by the ckb blockchain node.

2. What dependencies does this code use?

   This code uses several dependencies, including `ckb_app_config`, `ckb_db`, `ckb_db_migration`, `ckb_db_schema`, `ckb_error`, `ckb_hash`, `ckb_store`, and `ckb_types`.

3. What is the significance of the `AddBlockFilterHash` struct?

   The `AddBlockFilterHash` struct is a migration that adds block filter hashes to the database. It implements the `Migration` trait, which defines the `migrate`, `version`, and `expensive` methods used by the migration framework.
