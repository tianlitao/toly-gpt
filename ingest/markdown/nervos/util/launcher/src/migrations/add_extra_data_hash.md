The code is a migration script that adds a new column to a RocksDB database used in the ckb project. Specifically, it adds a new column called `COLUMN_CELL_DATA_HASH` to the database and populates it with data from the existing `COLUMN_CELL_DATA` column. The purpose of this migration is to improve the performance of certain queries that require access to the data hash of a cell.

The `AddExtraDataHash` struct defines the migration and implements the `Migration` trait. The `migrate` function is called when the migration is run and takes in a RocksDB instance and a progress bar. The function iterates over the `COLUMN_CELL_DATA` column in batches of up to `LIMIT` entries at a time, extracts the data hash from each entry, and writes it to the new `COLUMN_CELL_DATA_HASH` column. The `mode` function is used to determine the starting point of each batch based on the last key processed in the previous batch.

The `version` function returns a string representing the version of the migration. In this case, the version is hardcoded as `20210609195049`.

This migration can be used as part of a larger project to update the schema of a RocksDB database used by the project. For example, if a new feature is added to the project that requires access to the data hash of a cell, this migration can be run to add the new column and populate it with the necessary data. Once the migration is complete, the project can use the new column to improve the performance of the feature.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a migration script that adds a new column to a RocksDB database for storing the hash of cell data.

2. What is the significance of the `COLUMN_CELL_DATA` and `COLUMN_CELL_DATA_HASH` constants?
   - `COLUMN_CELL_DATA` and `COLUMN_CELL_DATA_HASH` are constants that represent the names of the columns in the RocksDB database that store cell data and cell data hashes, respectively.

3. What is the purpose of the `ProgressBar` and `ProgressStyle` types?
   - The `ProgressBar` and `ProgressStyle` types are used to display a progress bar during the execution of the migration script. The `ProgressBar` type represents the progress bar itself, while the `ProgressStyle` type is used to customize the appearance of the progress bar.
