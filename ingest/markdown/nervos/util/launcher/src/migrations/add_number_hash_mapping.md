The code is a migration script for the ckb project's database. Specifically, it adds a mapping between block numbers and their corresponding hashes to the database. This mapping is stored in a new column called `COLUMN_NUMBER_HASH`. The purpose of this migration is to improve the efficiency of certain queries that require looking up blocks by their number.

The migration is implemented as a struct called `AddNumberHashMapping` that implements the `Migration` trait. The `migrate` method takes a RocksDB instance and a progress bar as input, and returns a new RocksDB instance. The migration is performed in a multi-threaded manner using the `multi_thread_migration` macro.

The migration iterates over all blocks in the database and calculates the number of transactions in each block. For each block, it constructs a key-value pair where the key is a combination of the block number and hash, and the value is the number of transactions in the block. This key-value pair is then added to the `COLUMN_NUMBER_HASH` column using the `put` method.

The migration uses a write batch (`wb`) to improve performance. The batch is written to the database using the `write` method when it reaches a certain size (`BATCH`). The progress bar is updated for each block processed.

Overall, this migration improves the efficiency of certain queries by adding a new column to the database. It is intended to be run once as part of the ckb project's setup process. An example of how this migration might be used in the larger project is to speed up the process of finding a block by its number, which is a common operation in the ckb project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   
   This code is a migration script for the ckb database. It adds a mapping between block numbers and hashes to the database, along with the number of transactions in each block.

2. What dependencies does this code use and what do they do?
   
   This code uses several dependencies, including `ckb_app_config` for storing configuration data, `ckb_db` for interacting with the database, `ckb_db_migration` for performing database migrations, `ckb_db_schema` for defining the database schema, `ckb_migration_template` for multi-threaded migrations, `ckb_store` for storing blockchain data, and `ckb_types` for defining blockchain data types.

3. What is the purpose of the `multi_thread_migration` macro and how is it used in this code?
   
   The `multi_thread_migration` macro is used to perform a database migration in parallel across multiple threads. In this code, it is used to iterate over a range of block numbers and add a mapping between each block number and its hash to the database. The macro takes a closure that defines the migration logic to be executed in parallel.
