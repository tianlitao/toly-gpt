The `Export` struct in this code is responsible for exporting blocks from a CKB (Nervos Network) database to a specified file in JSON format.

The struct has two fields: `target`, which is the path to the file where the blocks will be exported, and `shared`, which is a reference to the shared data of the CKB node.

The `new` method is used to create a new instance of the `Export` struct, taking in the `shared` and `target` parameters.

The `file_name` method returns the name of the file that will be created, which is a combination of the CKB consensus ID and the file extension `.json`.

The `execute` method creates the directory specified in `target` if it doesn't exist, and then calls the `write_to_json` method to write the blocks to the file.

The `write_to_json` method is where the actual exporting happens. It opens the file specified in `target` using `OpenOptions`, and then creates a `BufWriter` to write to the file. It then gets a snapshot of the CKB database using `shared.snapshot()`, and creates a `ChainIterator` to iterate over the blocks in the chain.

For each block in the chain, the method converts it to a `JsonBlock` using `into()`, serializes it to JSON using `serde_json::to_vec()`, and writes the resulting bytes to the file using `write_all()`. It also writes a newline character after each block.

If the `progress_bar` feature is enabled, the method creates a progress bar using the `ProgressBar` struct from the `indicatif` crate, and sets its style and template. It then iterates over the blocks in the chain using `blocks_iter`, increments the progress bar for each block, and finishes the progress bar when done.

Finally, the method returns `Ok(())` if everything was successful, or a `Box<dyn Error>` if an error occurred.

Overall, this code provides a way to export blocks from a CKB database to a file in JSON format, which could be useful for analyzing or sharing data about the blockchain.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code?

   This code exports the CKB blockchain into a JSON file.

2. What dependencies does this code have?

   This code depends on `ckb_chain_iter`, `ckb_jsonrpc_types`, `ckb_shared`, `indicatif`, `serde_json`, `std::error`, `std::fs`, `std::io`, and `std::path`.

3. What is the difference between the `write_to_json` function with and without the `progress_bar` feature?

   The `write_to_json` function with the `progress_bar` feature displays a progress bar while exporting the blockchain to JSON, while the `write_to_json` function without the `progress_bar` feature does not display a progress bar.
