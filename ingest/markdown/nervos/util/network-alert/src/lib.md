This file contains documentation for the Network Alert system in the ckb project. The Network Alert system is a feature that allows the CKB core team to send an urgent alert message across the CKB P2P network in case of a crisis bug. This is similar to the alert system used in Bitcoin. The purpose of this system is to notify clients of an urgent situation without affecting the other behaviors of the CKB node.

The file includes a link to the Bitcoin alert system wiki page for historical context. The Network Alert system is implemented in CKB for early stages of development when crisis bugs may occur. Once the CKB network is considered mature, the Network Alert system will be removed.

The file also includes modules for alert_relayer, notifier, and verifier, as well as a test module. The BAD_MESSAGE_BAN_TIME constant is defined as a duration of 5 minutes, which is used to ban nodes that send bad messages.

Overall, this file serves as documentation for the Network Alert system in the ckb project, providing context and information on its purpose and implementation. Developers working on the project can use this information to understand how the Network Alert system works and how it may be used in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Network Alert system in CKB?
   - The Network Alert system is implemented in CKB for urgent situations and allows the core team to send an alert message across the P2P network to be displayed by clients, without changing the other behaviors of the CKB node.
2. Why is the Network Alert system being removed?
   - The Network Alert system will be removed once the CKB network is considered mature.
3. What is the significance of the `BAD_MESSAGE_BAN_TIME` constant?
   - The `BAD_MESSAGE_BAN_TIME` constant is a duration of 5 minutes that represents the amount of time a node will be banned from the network if it sends a bad message.
