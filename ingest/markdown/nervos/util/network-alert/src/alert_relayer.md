The `AlertRelayer` module implements a Bitcoin-like alert system that allows n of m alert key holders to send alert messages to all clients. The purpose of this system is to provide a way to reach consensus offline under critical bugs. The module provides a CLI to generate alert messages and a configuration option to set alert messages to broadcast.

The `AlertRelayer` struct has three fields: `notifier`, `verifier`, and `known_lists`. The `notifier` field is an `Arc<Mutex<Notifier>>` that provides a way to notify clients of new alerts. The `verifier` field is an `Arc<Verifier>` that provides a way to verify the signatures of alert messages. The `known_lists` field is an `LruCache` that stores a list of known alerts for each peer.

The `AlertRelayer` struct has three methods: `new`, `notifier`, and `verifier`. The `new` method initializes a new `AlertRelayer` struct with the given client version, notify controller, and signature configuration. The `notifier` method returns a reference to the `notifier` field. The `verifier` method returns a reference to the `verifier` field.

The `AlertRelayer` struct also implements the `CKBProtocolHandler` trait, which provides methods for handling CKB network protocols. The `init` method initializes the protocol handler. The `connected` method is called when a new peer connects to the network. It sends any new alerts to the peer. The `received` method is called when a new alert is received from a peer. It verifies the alert, marks the sender as known, broadcasts the alert to other peers, and adds the alert to the list of received alerts.

In summary, the `AlertRelayer` module provides a way to implement a Bitcoin-like alert system that allows n of m alert key holders to send alert messages to all clients. It provides a CLI to generate alert messages and a configuration option to set alert messages to broadcast. The module uses a `Notifier` to notify clients of new alerts, a `Verifier` to verify the signatures of alert messages, and an `LruCache` to store a list of known alerts for each peer. The module implements the `CKBProtocolHandler` trait to handle CKB network protocols.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code?

    This code implements a Bitcoin-like alert system where n of m alert key holders can send alert messages to all clients to reach consensus offline under critical bugs. It includes a CLI to generate alert messages and a config option to set alert messages to broadcast.

2. What data structures are used in this code?

    This code uses a `Mutex` to protect shared data, an `LruCache` to store a cache of known alert IDs for each peer, and a `HashSet` to store the set of known alert IDs for each peer.

3. What is the role of the `CKBProtocolHandler` trait in this code?

    The `CKBProtocolHandler` trait is implemented by the `AlertRelayer` struct to handle CKB network protocol messages. It defines methods to initialize the protocol, handle connections, and handle received messages.
