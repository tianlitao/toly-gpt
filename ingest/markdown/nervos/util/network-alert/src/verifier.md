The `Verifier` module is responsible for verifying messages in the ckb project. The purpose of this module is to ensure that messages are verified by multi-signature before notifying the user. This is done to prevent useless information from being broadcast on the entire network. The set of public keys is currently in the possession of the Nervos foundation.

The `Verifier` struct has two fields: `config` and `pubkeys`. The `config` field is of type `NetworkAlertConfig` and contains the configuration for the network alert. The `pubkeys` field is a `HashSet` of `Pubkey` structs, which represent the public keys used for multi-signature verification.

The `Verifier` struct has two methods: `new` and `verify_signatures`. The `new` method initializes a new `Verifier` instance with the given `config`. It also initializes the `pubkeys` field by parsing the raw bytes of each public key in the `config` and adding them to a `HashSet`.

The `verify_signatures` method takes an `alert` of type `packed::Alert` and verifies its signatures. It first creates a `Message` from the `alert` by calculating its hash. It then filters the `signatures` in the `alert` by checking if they are valid. If a signature is invalid, it is discarded. If a signature is valid, it is added to a `Vec` of `Signature` structs. Finally, the `verify_m_of_n` function from the `ckb_multisig::secp256k1` module is called to verify the multi-signature. This function takes the `message`, the `signatures_threshold`, the `signatures`, and the `pubkeys` as arguments. If the verification is successful, the method returns `Ok(())`. Otherwise, it returns an `AnyError`.

This module can be used in the larger ckb project to ensure that messages are verified before being broadcast on the network. It can be used by calling the `new` method to initialize a new `Verifier` instance and then calling the `verify_signatures` method to verify the signatures of an `alert`. For example:

```rust
let config = NetworkAlertConfig::default();
let verifier = Verifier::new(config);
let alert = packed::Alert::default();
verifier.verify_signatures(&alert)?;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code is a message verification module that verifies a message by multi-signature before notifying the user. The set of public keys is currently in the possession of the Nervos foundation.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
    
    This code has dependencies on `ckb_app_config`, `ckb_error`, `ckb_logger`, `ckb_multisig`, and `ckb_types` crates.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `verify_signatures` function?
    
    The `verify_signatures` function takes an alert of type `packed::Alert` as input and returns a `Result<(), AnyError>` indicating whether the verification was successful or not.
