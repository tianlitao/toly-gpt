The code defines a `LinkedHashSet` struct, which is a wrapper around a `LinkedHashMap` from the `linked_hash_map` crate. The `LinkedHashSet` holds values in insertion order, which is not guaranteed by the standard `HashSet`. The `LinkedHashSet` struct has methods for inserting, checking for the presence of, and removing elements, as well as iterating over the elements in insertion order. It also has a method for computing the difference between two `LinkedHashSet` instances.

The `LinkedHashSet` struct is generic over the type of the elements it holds, as well as the hash builder used to hash those elements. By default, it uses the `DefaultHasher` from the standard library.

The `LinkedHashSet` struct has two constructors: `new()` creates an empty `LinkedHashSet`, and `with_capacity(capacity: usize)` creates an empty `LinkedHashSet` with the given initial capacity.

The `LinkedHashSet` struct has methods for checking if an element is present (`contains()`), getting the number of elements (`len()`), checking if the set is empty (`is_empty()`), inserting an element (`insert()`), iterating over the elements (`iter()`), computing the difference between two sets (`difference()`), and clearing the set (`clear()`).

The `LinkedHashSet` struct also implements the `Extend` trait, which allows it to be extended with elements from an iterator. It also implements the `IntoIterator` trait, which allows it to be iterated over by value or by reference.

The `LinkedHashSet` struct has two associated types: `Iter`, which is an iterator over the elements in insertion order, and `Difference`, which is an iterator over the elements that are in one set but not the other.

The `Iter` struct is a wrapper around the `Keys` iterator of the underlying `LinkedHashMap`. It implements the `Iterator` trait, allowing it to be used in for loops and other iterator contexts.

The `Difference` struct is an iterator over the elements that are in one set but not the other. It is constructed by calling the `difference()` method on one set and passing in another set. It implements the `Iterator` trait, allowing it to be used in for loops and other iterator contexts.

The code includes examples of how to use the `LinkedHashSet` struct, including creating a new set, inserting elements, iterating over the elements, and computing the difference between two sets.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used?
- This code provides a `HashSet` wrapper that holds values in insertion order. It can be used to create a `LinkedHashSet` and perform operations such as inserting values, checking if a value is present, getting the number of elements, getting an iterator of all elements in insertion order, and finding the difference between two sets.

2. What is the difference between `LinkedHashSet` and a regular `HashSet`?
- `LinkedHashSet` holds values in insertion order, while a regular `HashSet` does not guarantee any particular order of elements.

3. How does the `difference` method work?
- The `difference` method returns an iterator of the values that are in `self` but not in `other`. It does this by iterating over the elements in `self` and checking if they are present in `other`. If an element is not present in `other`, it is returned by the iterator.
