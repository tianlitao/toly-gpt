The code provided contains several implementations of functions that calculate the serialized size of different entities in the CKB (Nervos Network) blockchain. The serialized size is the number of bytes required to represent an entity in binary format.

The `impl_serialized_size_for_entity!` macro is used to generate the implementations of the `serialized_size_in_block` function for different entities. This function calculates the serialized size of an entity when it is included in a block. For example, the `packed::TransactionReader` implementation calculates the size of a transaction in a block, taking into account the extra space required to store an offset in the block header.

The `packed::BlockReader` implementation calculates the serialized size of a block without uncle proposals. It first calculates the total serialized size of the block, then subtracts the serialized size of each uncle's proposal vector. Even if an uncle has no proposals, its proposal vector still has a header that contains its total size.

The `packed::UncleBlock` implementation calculates the serialized size of an uncle block in a block. When a block has one more uncle, the block will have one more offset in the `UncleBlockVec`, and the `UncleBlockVec` will have one more `UncleBlock`. The `UncleBlock` contains a header and an empty proposal vector, which includes only one total size field.

Finally, the `packed::ProposalShortId` implementation simply returns the serialized size of a proposal short ID, which is a fixed size of 10 bytes.

These functions are used to calculate the size of different entities in the CKB blockchain, which is useful for various purposes such as optimizing block size and transaction fees. For example, a miner can use these functions to estimate the size of a block before mining it, and adjust the block's content accordingly to maximize the block's reward.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `impl_serialized_size_for_entity` macro and how is it used in this code?
   - The `impl_serialized_size_for_entity` macro is used to generate implementations of the `serialized_size_in_block` function for different entities. It takes in the name of the entity and the name of the function to generate, and optionally a link to the reader function. It is used to reduce code duplication and make it easier to add new entities in the future.

2. What is the difference between `serialized_size_in_block` and `serialized_size_without_uncle_proposals` functions?
   - `serialized_size_in_block` calculates the serialized size of a `Transaction` in a `Block`, taking into account the extra space needed to store an offset in the header. `serialized_size_without_uncle_proposals` calculates the serialized size of a `Block` without the serialized size of the uncle proposals.

3. What is the purpose of the `serialized_size` functions for `UncleBlock` and `ProposalShortId`?
   - The `serialized_size` functions for `UncleBlock` and `ProposalShortId` calculate the serialized size of those entities. `serialized_size_in_block` for `UncleBlock` takes into account the extra space needed for the additional uncle block, while `serialized_size` for `ProposalShortId` returns a fixed value of 10.
