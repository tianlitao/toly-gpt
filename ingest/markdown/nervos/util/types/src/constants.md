This code defines two constants, `TX_VERSION` and `BLOCK_VERSION`, which are both of type `Version`. These constants are used to represent the current transaction and block versions in the larger project.

The `Version` type is likely defined elsewhere in the project and is used to represent a version number. By defining these constants, the project can easily reference the current transaction and block versions without having to hardcode the values throughout the codebase.

For example, if a function needs to check the transaction version, it can simply reference the `TX_VERSION` constant instead of hardcoding the value `0`. This makes the code more readable and maintainable, as any changes to the current version can be made in one place (i.e. updating the value of the constant) instead of having to search through the entire codebase for hardcoded values.

Here is an example of how these constants might be used in the larger project:

```rust
use crate::core::{Version, Transaction};

fn validate_transaction(tx: Transaction) -> bool {
    if tx.version != TX_VERSION {
        return false;
    }
    // other validation logic
    true
}
```

In this example, the `validate_transaction` function takes a `Transaction` as input and checks if its version matches the current transaction version (`TX_VERSION`). If the versions do not match, the function returns `false`.

Overall, this code serves as a simple and efficient way to manage version numbers in the larger project.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `Version` struct in this code?
   - The `Version` struct is likely used to represent a version number for the transaction and block in the ckb project.

2. Why are the transaction and block versions both set to 0?
   - It's unclear from this code snippet why the transaction and block versions are both set to 0. A smart developer might want to investigate further to see if this is intentional or if it needs to be updated.

3. Are there any other constants defined in this file?
   - It's possible that there are other constants defined in this file that are not shown in this code snippet. A smart developer might want to review the entire file to see if there are any other important constants that need to be documented.
