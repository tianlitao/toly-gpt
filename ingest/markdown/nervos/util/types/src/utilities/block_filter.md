The code provided is a Rust module that provides functionality for building block filter data and calculating block filter hashes. The module defines a trait called `FilterDataProvider` that provides an interface for finding a cell through its out point. It also defines a function called `build_filter_data` that takes a `FilterDataProvider` implementation and a slice of `TransactionView`s as input and returns a tuple containing the filter data and a vector of missing out points. The `build_filter_data` function builds a Golomb Coded Set (GCS) filter using the `build_gcs_filter` function and adds elements to the filter for each input and output cell in each transaction in the input slice. The function then returns the filter data and a vector of missing out points, which are out points that were referenced in the input transactions but were not found in the `FilterDataProvider`.

The module also defines a function called `calc_filter_hash` that takes a parent block filter hash and filter data as input and returns a 32-byte array representing the block filter hash. The function uses the BLAKE2b-256 hash function to hash the concatenation of the parent block filter hash and the raw data hash of the filter data.

The `build_gcs_filter` function is a helper function that takes a mutable reference to a `Write` trait object and returns a `GCSFilterWriter` instance. The `GCSFilterWriter` is a struct that provides functionality for building a GCS filter using a SipHasher24Builder, which is a hash function builder that produces a SipHasher24 instance. The `M` and `P` constants are parameters used in the GCS filter construction.

Overall, this module provides important functionality for building block filter data and calculating block filter hashes, which are used in the CKB project to enable efficient transaction filtering and block propagation. The `FilterDataProvider` trait allows for flexible implementation of cell lookup, and the GCS filter construction provides a space-efficient way to represent a set of elements.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FilterDataProvider` trait?
- The `FilterDataProvider` trait provides a method to find a cell through its out point.

2. What is the `build_filter_data` function doing?
- The `build_filter_data` function takes a `FilterDataProvider` and a slice of `TransactionView`s as input, and builds filter data for the transactions. It calculates the lock and script hashes for input and output cells, and adds them to a GCS filter.

3. What is the `calc_filter_hash` function used for?
- The `calc_filter_hash` function takes a parent block filter hash and filter data as input, and calculates a block filter hash by concatenating and hashing the two inputs using the blake2b_256 algorithm.
