This code defines types and functions for variable difficulty Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) in CKB. MMR is a data structure used to store and verify the blockchain data. The code implements the `Merge` trait for the `MergeHeaderDigest` struct, which is used to merge two MMR nodes. It also defines the `ChainRootMMR` and `MMRProof` types, which represent the MMR root and proof, respectively.

The `VerifiableHeader` struct represents a header and the fields used to verify its extra hash. It has methods to check if the header is valid and to retrieve its fields. The `ProverMessageBuilder` trait defines a builder for the content of a message used for proving.

The code also defines methods for getting the MMR header digest of a block or header, and for verifying the MMR header digest. The `packed` module contains packed structs used to store data in a compact format.

Overall, this code provides the necessary types and functions to implement MMR in CKB and to verify the validity of headers. It can be used in the larger CKB project to store and verify blockchain data. Below is an example of how to use the `VerifiableHeader` struct to check if a header is valid:

```rust
let header = HeaderView::new(...);
let uncles_hash = packed::Byte32::zero();
let extension = None;
let parent_chain_root = packed::HeaderDigest::zero();
let verifiable_header = VerifiableHeader::new(header, uncles_hash, extension, parent_chain_root);
let mmr_activated_epoch = EpochNumber::new(0);
let is_valid = verifiable_header.is_valid(mmr_activated_epoch);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MergeHeaderDigest` struct and how is it used in the code?
   
   `MergeHeaderDigest` is a struct that implements the `Merge` trait for `packed::HeaderDigest`. It is used to merge two `HeaderDigest` instances into a single instance, which is used to calculate the root of the Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) for headers.

2. What is the `VerifiableHeader` struct and what is its purpose in the code?
   
   `VerifiableHeader` is a struct that represents a header and the fields used to verify its extra hash. It is used to check if a header is valid by verifying its extra hash and checking if it has a chain root.

3. What is the purpose of the `ProverMessageBuilder` trait and how is it used in the code?
   
   `ProverMessageBuilder` is a trait that defines a builder for creating a message used for proving. It is used to build messages for sending proofs of last state, blocks, and transactions. The trait defines methods for setting the last header, proof, proved items, and missing items for the message.
