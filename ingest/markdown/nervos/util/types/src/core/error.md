This code defines two error types related to transactions and out-points in the CKB (Nervos Common Knowledge Base) project. These errors are used to indicate various issues that may arise when validating transactions and their associated out-points.

The `OutPointError` enum defines several error variants that may occur when validating out-points. These include errors related to dead cells, unknown cells, out-of-order cells, invalid dependency groups, and invalid headers. The `TransactionError` enum defines several error variants that may occur when validating transactions. These include errors related to insufficient cell capacity, output and input mismatches, empty inputs or outputs, duplicate cell or header dependencies, output data length mismatches, invalid since fields, immature transactions, mismatched versions, exceeded maximum block bytes, and compatibility issues.

The purpose of these error types is to provide a way to handle errors that may occur during transaction validation. These errors can be used to provide more detailed information to users about why their transactions may have failed to validate. For example, if a user tries to create a transaction with insufficient cell capacity, they will receive an error message indicating which output has insufficient capacity and what the expected and actual capacities are.

These error types are used throughout the CKB project to validate transactions and out-points. For example, the `TransactionVerifier` struct uses these error types to validate transactions before they are added to the blockchain. The `OutPointResolver` struct uses the `OutPointError` type to handle errors related to out-points when resolving them during transaction validation.

Overall, these error types are an important part of the CKB project's transaction validation process. They provide a way to handle errors that may occur during validation and provide more detailed information to users about why their transactions may have failed to validate.
## Questions: 
 1. What are the possible errors that can occur due to out-point rules not being respected?
- The possible errors are: Dead, Unknown, OutOfOrder, InvalidDepGroup, InvalidHeader, and OverMaxDepExpansionLimit.

2. What are the possible sources of transaction errors?
- The possible sources of transaction errors are: CellDeps, HeaderDeps, Inputs, Outputs, OutputsData, and Witnesses.

3. What method can be used to check if an OutPointError is due to an unknown out-point?
- The method `is_unknown()` can be used to check if an OutPointError is due to an unknown out-point.
