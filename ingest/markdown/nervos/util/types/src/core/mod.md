The code in this file provides essential Rust types for the CKB (Nervos Common Knowledge Base) project. The CKB project is a public blockchain that aims to provide a secure, decentralized, and scalable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications.

The module contains several sub-modules, including `cell`, `error`, `hardfork`, `service`, and `tx_pool`. These sub-modules provide functionality related to cells (the basic unit of data storage in the CKB blockchain), error handling, hardfork management, transaction pool management, and more.

In addition to the sub-modules, the module also provides several types that are essential to the CKB project. These types include `BlockNumber`, `EpochNumber`, `Cycle`, and `Version`, which are all aliases for Rust primitive types. The module also provides several custom types, such as `PublicKey`, which is a 512-bit fixed binary data type representing a public key.

The module also exports several functions and structs that are used throughout the CKB project. For example, the `BlockBuilder`, `HeaderBuilder`, and `TransactionBuilder` structs are used to construct blocks, headers, and transactions, respectively. The `BlockView`, `HeaderView`, and `TransactionView` structs are used to view blocks, headers, and transactions, respectively.

Overall, this module provides essential Rust types and functionality for the CKB project. It is used throughout the project to manage cells, transactions, blocks, and more.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this module and what types does it provide?
- This module provides essential rust types for CKB and most of them are composed of packed bytes or can convert between self and packed bytes.
2. What are some of the sub-modules included in this module?
- Some of the sub-modules included in this module are `cell`, `error`, `hardfork`, `service`, and `tx_pool`.
3. What are some of the types that can be used outside of this module?
- Some of the types that can be used outside of this module include `BlockBuilder`, `HeaderBuilder`, `TransactionBuilder`, `DepType`, `ScriptHashType`, `FeeRate`, `BlockEconomicState`, `BlockIssuance`, `BlockReward`, `MinerReward`, `TransactionMeta`, `TransactionMetaBuilder`, and various views.
