This code defines two enums, `ScriptHashType` and `DepType`, which are used to specify how script code is matched and run, and the type of a dependency, respectively.

The `ScriptHashType` enum has three variants: `Data`, `Type`, and `Data1`. The `Data` variant matches script code via cell data hash and runs the script code in v0 CKB VM. The `Type` variant matches script code via cell type script hash. The `Data1` variant matches script code via cell data hash and runs the script code in v1 CKB VM. The `verify_value` method checks that the value of a `ScriptHashType` instance is within the valid range of 0 to 2. The `TryFrom` trait is implemented for both `u8` and `packed::Byte` types, allowing conversion from these types to `ScriptHashType`. The `Into` trait is also implemented for both `u8` and `packed::Byte` types, allowing conversion from `ScriptHashType` to these types.

The `DepType` enum has two variants: `Code` and `DepGroup`. The `Code` variant represents a code dependency, while the `DepGroup` variant represents a dependency group. The `verify_value` method checks that the value of a `DepType` instance is within the valid range of 0 to 1. The `TryFrom` trait is implemented for `packed::Byte`, allowing conversion from this type to `DepType`. The `Into` trait is implemented for both `u8` and `packed::Byte` types, allowing conversion from `DepType` to these types.

These enums are used throughout the larger project to specify the type of script hash and dependency. For example, in the `packed` module, the `Script` struct has a `hash_type` field of type `ScriptHashType`, which specifies how the script `code_hash` is used to match the script code and how to run the code. Similarly, the `CellDep` struct has a `dep_type` field of type `DepType`, which specifies the type of the dependency.

Overall, these enums provide a way to specify and enforce the type of script hash and dependency used in the project.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `ScriptHashType` enum and how is it used?
- The `ScriptHashType` enum specifies how the script `code_hash` is used to match the script code and how to run the code. It is used to convert between different representations of script hash types and to verify that a given value is a valid script hash type.

2. What is the purpose of the `DepType` enum and how is it used?
- The `DepType` enum represents the type of a cell dependency, either `Code` or `DepGroup`. It is used to convert between different representations of dependency types and to verify that a given value is a valid dependency type.

3. What is the purpose of the `verify_value` functions in both enums?
- The `verify_value` functions are used to verify that a given value is a valid enum variant. They return `true` if the value is valid and `false` otherwise. These functions are used internally to ensure that only valid values are used when converting between different representations of the enums.
