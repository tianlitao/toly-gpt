This code defines an enum called `ExitCode` which represents the exit codes that can be used by a process. The enum has four variants: `Cli`, `Config`, `IO`, and `Failure`. Each variant has a specific integer value associated with it, which can be used as the exit code for the process. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of handling process exit codes in the larger project. By using this enum, the project can ensure that all processes use the same exit codes for the same types of errors. This makes it easier to write scripts and other tools that interact with the project's processes.

The `ExitCode` enum also provides a method called `into` which converts the enum variant into a signed 32-bit integer. This integer can be used as the process exit status. For example, if a process encounters an error while parsing command line arguments, it can set its exit code to `ExitCode::Cli.into()` to indicate that the error was a command line argument error.

The `From` trait is implemented for several error types, including `io::Error`, `toml::de::Error`, `ckb_logger::SetLoggerError`, and `clap::Error`. This allows these error types to be converted into an `ExitCode`. When an error of one of these types is encountered, the `From` implementation prints an error message to standard error and returns the appropriate `ExitCode`. For example, if an `io::Error` is encountered, the `From` implementation prints an error message and returns `ExitCode::IO`.

Overall, this code provides a standardized way of handling process exit codes in the larger project. By using the `ExitCode` enum and the `From` trait implementations, the project can ensure that all processes use the same exit codes for the same types of errors. This makes it easier to write scripts and other tools that interact with the project's processes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ExitCode` enum?
   
   The `ExitCode` enum is used to represent different exit codes for the ckb process, with specific codes for different types of errors.

2. What is the `into` method used for in the `ExitCode` implementation?
   
   The `into` method is used to convert an `ExitCode` enum variant into a signed 32-bit integer that can be used as the process exit status.

3. Why are there multiple `From` implementations for different error types?
   
   There are multiple `From` implementations for different error types to allow for easy conversion of those errors into the appropriate `ExitCode` enum variant, which can then be used to set the process exit status.
