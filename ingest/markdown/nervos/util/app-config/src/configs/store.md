[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/develop/util/app-config/src/configs/store.rs)

This code defines a struct called `Config` that stores various configuration options for the ckb project. The struct has several fields, each representing a different configuration option. These options include the maximum number of cached block headers, cell data, block proposals, transaction hashes, uncles, and extensions. Additionally, there is a boolean field called `freezer_enable` that determines whether or not the freezer feature is enabled.

The `Config` struct is annotated with several Rust attributes, including `Copy`, `Clone`, `Serialize`, `Eq`, `PartialEq`, `Hash`, and `Debug`. These attributes provide various functionality to the struct, such as the ability to make copies of it, serialize it to a byte stream, and compare it for equality.

This code is likely used throughout the ckb project to store and retrieve configuration options. For example, other parts of the project may read the `header_cache_size` field to determine the maximum number of cached block headers, or set the `freezer_enable` field to enable or disable the freezer feature.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```rust
use ckb::Config;

fn main() {
    let config = Config {
        header_cache_size: 100,
        cell_data_cache_size: 200,
        block_proposals_cache_size: 50,
        block_tx_hashes_cache_size: 500,
        block_uncles_cache_size: 20,
        block_extensions_cache_size: 10,
        freezer_enable: true,
    };

    // Use the config object to configure other parts of the project
    // ...
}
```

In this example, a `Config` object is created with some example configuration options. These options could then be used to configure other parts of the ckb project.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code and where is it used in the ckb project?
- This code defines a struct called `Config` that stores various cache sizes and a boolean flag for enabling freezer. It is likely used in the caching mechanism of the ckb project.

2. What is the significance of the `#[derive(Copy, Clone, Serialize, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, Debug)]` attribute above the `Config` struct?
- This attribute specifies that the `Config` struct should automatically implement several traits, including `Copy`, `Clone`, `Serialize`, `Eq`, `PartialEq`, `Hash`, and `Debug`. This can save time and effort when working with the struct.

3. What is the purpose of the `header_cache_size` and `cell_data_cache_size` fields in the `Config` struct?
- These fields specify the maximum number of cached block headers and cell data, respectively. This can help improve performance by reducing the need to fetch this data from disk or other sources repeatedly.
