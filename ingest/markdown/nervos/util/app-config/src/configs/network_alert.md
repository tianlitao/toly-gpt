The code defines a struct called `Config` that represents the network alert configuration options. The struct has two fields: `signatures_threshold` and `public_keys`. `signatures_threshold` is an integer that represents the minimum number of required signatures to send a network alert. `public_keys` is a vector of `JsonBytes` that represents the public keys of all the network alert signers.

The `Config` struct implements the `Default` trait, which provides a default value for the struct. The `default` function reads the alert system configuration from a TOML file called `alert_signature.toml` and returns a `Config` struct. The `include_bytes!` macro is used to read the contents of the file at compile time and convert it to a byte array. The `toml::from_slice` function is then used to deserialize the byte array into a `Config` struct.

This code is part of the larger ckb project, which is a public blockchain that aims to provide a decentralized and secure infrastructure for the future of the internet. The network alert system is an important component of the ckb project, as it allows the network to be alerted in case of critical issues or security vulnerabilities. The `Config` struct provides a way to configure the network alert system by specifying the minimum number of required signatures and the public keys of the signers. This allows the ckb project to customize the network alert system to meet its specific needs.

Here is an example of how the `Config` struct can be used:

```rust
use ckb_jsonrpc_types::JsonBytes;

// Create a new Config struct with default values
let config = Config::default();

// Print the minimum number of required signatures
println!("Signatures threshold: {}", config.signatures_threshold);

// Print the public keys of the signers
for public_key in config.public_keys {
    println!("Public key: {}", public_key);
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ckb_jsonrpc_types` and `serde` crates being used in this file?
   - The `ckb_jsonrpc_types` crate is being used to define the `JsonBytes` type, while the `serde` crate is being used for serialization and deserialization of the `Config` struct.
   
2. What is the `Config` struct used for and what fields does it contain?
   - The `Config` struct is used to hold network alert configuration options, and it contains two fields: `signatures_threshold` (the minimum number of required signatures to send a network alert) and `public_keys` (the public keys of all the network alert signers).
   
3. What is the purpose of the `Default` implementation for the `Config` struct?
   - The `Default` implementation for the `Config` struct provides a default alert system configuration by reading from a TOML file located at `./alert_signature.toml`.
