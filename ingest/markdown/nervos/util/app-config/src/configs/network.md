This code defines a configuration struct `Config` for a network service. The struct contains various options for configuring the behavior of the network service, such as maximum number of connected peers, network data storage directory path, list of DNS servers to discover peers, and more. The struct also contains methods for reading and writing the network secret key, generating a random key if the file does not exist, and getting the list of whitelist peers and bootnodes.

The `Config` struct is used in the larger project to configure the behavior of the network service. For example, the `max_peers` option can be used to limit the number of connected peers to prevent overloading the network service, while the `dns_seeds` option can be used to discover peers using DNS servers. The `fetch_private_key` method can be used to read or generate a private key for the network service, which is used for secure communication with other peers.

The code also defines a `SyncConfig` struct for configuring chain synchronization options, such as the header map configuration and minimum chain work. The `SupportProtocol` enum lists the supported protocols for the network service, such as ping, discovery, and sync.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and configurable network service for the larger project, allowing for fine-grained control over the behavior of the network and chain synchronization.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Config` struct and what options does it provide?
- The `Config` struct provides network configuration options for the ckb project, such as maximum number of allowed connected peers, network data storage directory path, list of DNS servers to discover peers, and more.
2. What is the purpose of the `SyncConfig` struct and what options does it provide?
- The `SyncConfig` struct provides chain synchronization configuration options for the ckb project, such as header map configuration options, block hash of assume valid target, and proof of minimum work during synchronization.
3. What is the purpose of the `generate_random_key` function and where is it used?
- The `generate_random_key` function generates a random 32-byte key for use in the Secio protocol. It is used in the `write_secret_key_to_file` function to generate a random secret key and save it into the file.
