The `ckb_fixed_hash` module provides several simple fixed-sized hash data types and their static constructors. The purpose of this module is to allow developers to use fixed-sized hash data types in their Rust programs. The module provides four hash data types: `H160`, `H256`, `H512`, and `H520`. Each of these data types represents a fixed-sized hash value of 160, 256, 512, and 520 bits, respectively.

The module also provides four macros: `h160!`, `h256!`, `h512!`, and `h520!`. These macros are used to create a const hash value from a hexadecimal string or a trimmed hexadecimal string. The macros take a single argument, which is the hexadecimal string. The resulting const hash value can be used in Rust programs.

The module is used in the larger `ckb` project to provide fixed-sized hash data types for various purposes. For example, the `H256` data type is used to represent the hash of a block header in the `ckb` blockchain. The `H160` data type is used to represent the hash of an address in the `ckb` blockchain.

Here is an example of how to use the `H256` data type and the `h256!` macro:

```rust
use ckb_fixed_hash::{H256, h256};

const HASH: H256 = h256!("0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef");
```

In this example, we create a const hash value of type `H256` using the `h256!` macro. The resulting hash value is assigned to the `HASH` constant. The hash value is represented as a hexadecimal string.
