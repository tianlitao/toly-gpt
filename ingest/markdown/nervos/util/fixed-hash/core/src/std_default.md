This code defines a macro called `impl_std_default_default` that generates implementations of the `Default` trait for four different types: `H160`, `H256`, `H512`, and `H520`. These types are defined in other parts of the `ckb` project and represent fixed-size arrays of bytes with lengths of 20, 32, 64, and 65 bytes, respectively.

The `Default` trait is a built-in trait in Rust that provides a default value for a type. When a type implements `Default`, it can be created with a default value using the `Default::default()` method. This is useful for initializing variables or fields in structs with default values.

The macro generates implementations of `Default` for the four types by defining a function that returns a new instance of the type with all bytes set to zero. The `#[inline]` attribute is used to indicate that the function should be inlined by the compiler for performance reasons.

This code is a small but important part of the `ckb` project, as it provides default values for several types used throughout the project. For example, if a struct in the project contains a field of type `H256`, it can be initialized with a default value using `H256::default()`. This can simplify code and reduce the risk of bugs caused by uninitialized variables.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in a struct definition:

```
struct MyStruct {
    field1: H160,
    field2: H256,
    field3: H512,
    field4: H520,
}

impl MyStruct {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            field1: H160::default(),
            field2: H256::default(),
            field3: H512::default(),
            field4: H520::default(),
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `new()` method of `MyStruct` initializes each field with a default value using the `Default::default()` method.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `impl_std_default_default` macro?
   - The `impl_std_default_default` macro is used to implement the `Default` trait for types `H160`, `H256`, `H512`, and `H520` with default values of all zeros.
2. What are the sizes of the `H160`, `H256`, `H512`, and `H520` types?
   - The `H160` type has a size of 20 bytes, `H256` has a size of 32 bytes, `H512` has a size of 64 bytes, and `H520` has a size of 65 bytes.
3. What is the purpose of the `#[inline]` attribute in the `default` function?
   - The `#[inline]` attribute is used to suggest to the compiler that the `default` function should be inlined at the call site for better performance.
