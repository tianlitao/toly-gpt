The `Shared` struct in this code represents a shared state between different components of the CKB blockchain node. It contains references to various objects such as the chain database, transaction pool controller, consensus rules, and snapshot manager. The `Shared` struct provides methods to interact with these objects and perform various operations on them.

One of the methods provided by `Shared` is `spawn_freeze()`, which spawns a background thread that periodically checks and moves ancient data from the key-value database into the freezer. The freezer is a storage mechanism that stores old data that is no longer needed for normal operation of the node, but may be useful for debugging or analysis purposes. The freezer thread is started only if the freezer is enabled in the chain database.

Another method provided by `Shared` is `get_block_template()`, which generates and returns a block template that can be used to mine a new block. The method takes optional parameters for the maximum block size and maximum number of proposals to include in the block. It also takes an optional parameter for the maximum block version to use.

The `Shared` struct also provides methods for interacting with the transaction pool, snapshot manager, and consensus rules. It provides methods for getting and storing snapshots, refreshing snapshots, and creating new snapshots. It also provides methods for getting and cloning the consensus rules, and for checking whether the node is in initial block download mode.

Overall, the `Shared` struct provides a central point of access for various components of the CKB blockchain node to interact with shared state and perform various operations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FreezerClose` struct and how is it used?
   
   The `FreezerClose` struct is an owned permission to close on a freezer thread. It is used to signal the freezer thread to stop and clean up after itself when it is dropped.

2. What is the purpose of the `freeze` function and what does it do?
   
   The `freeze` function is called periodically by the freezer thread to move ancient data from the kv database into the freezer. It checks the current epoch and freezes data up to a certain threshold block number. It then wipes out the frozen data and compacts the block body.

3. What is the purpose of the `is_initial_block_download` function and how is it used?
   
   The `is_initial_block_download` function returns whether the chain is in initial block download. It is used to determine whether to skip freezing data during initial block download and to set a flag when initial block download is finished.
