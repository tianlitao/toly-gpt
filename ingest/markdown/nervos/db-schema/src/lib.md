This file contains constants that define the low level database column families for the ckb project. The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way to reference the different types of data that are stored in the database.

The code defines a type alias `Col` for a string slice (`&'static str`) to represent the column families. It also defines a constant `COLUMNS` which is the total number of columns.

The rest of the code consists of constants that represent the different column families. Each constant is a string slice that represents the name of the column family. For example, `COLUMN_BLOCK_HEADER` represents the column family for storing block headers.

These constants are used throughout the ckb project to reference the different types of data stored in the database. For example, when storing a block header in the database, the code would use the `COLUMN_BLOCK_HEADER` constant to specify the column family.

In addition to the column family constants, the code also defines constants for metadata keys. These keys are used to track information about the database, such as the latest known best block header and the current epoch.

Overall, this code provides a standardized way to reference the different types of data stored in the ckb database. By using these constants throughout the project, the code is more readable and maintainable.
