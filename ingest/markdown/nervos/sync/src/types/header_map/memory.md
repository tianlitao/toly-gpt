The `MemoryMap` struct is defined in this code file. It is used to store a map of `HeaderView` structs, which represent block headers in the CKB blockchain. The map is implemented as a `LinkedHashMap` wrapped in a `RwLock` to allow for concurrent read and write access.

The `MemoryMap` struct provides several methods for interacting with the map. The `contains_key` method checks if a given key (a `Byte32` hash value) is present in the map. The `get_refresh` method retrieves a value from the map and updates its position to the front of the map. The `insert` method adds a new key-value pair to the map. The `remove` method removes a key-value pair from the map and shrinks the map if its size exceeds a certain threshold. The `front_n` method retrieves the first `n` values in the map, where `n` is a given size limit. The `remove_batch` method removes a batch of keys from the map and shrinks the map if necessary.

This `MemoryMap` struct is used in the larger CKB project to cache block headers in memory. By storing frequently accessed headers in memory, the CKB node can avoid the overhead of reading them from disk repeatedly. The `MemoryMap` is used in several places throughout the CKB codebase, including in the `ChainService` and `HeaderViewVerifier` modules.

Example usage of the `MemoryMap` struct:

```rust
use ckb_chain::chain::ChainService;
use ckb_types::packed::Byte32;

let chain_service = ChainService::new(...);
let memory_map = chain_service.memory_map();

let block_hash: Byte32 = ...;
if memory_map.contains_key(&block_hash) {
    let header_view = memory_map.get_refresh(&block_hash).unwrap();
    // Do something with the header view...
} else {
    // Header not found in memory map, read from disk...
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MemoryMap` struct and what data does it store?
- The `MemoryMap` struct is used to store a map of `Byte32` keys to `HeaderView` values. It is used to cache headers in memory for faster access.

2. What is the significance of the `SHRINK_THRESHOLD` constant?
- The `SHRINK_THRESHOLD` constant is used to determine when the `LinkedHashMap` should be shrunk to fit its current size. When the number of elements in the map falls below this threshold, the map will be shrunk to reduce memory usage.

3. What is the purpose of the `front_n` method and how does it work?
- The `front_n` method returns the first `n` elements of the `LinkedHashMap` as a vector of `HeaderView` values. If the size of the map is greater than `n`, it returns the oldest `n` elements. If the size is less than or equal to `n`, it returns `None`.
