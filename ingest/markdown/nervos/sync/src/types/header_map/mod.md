The `HeaderMap` module is responsible for managing a key-value store of block headers. It provides methods for inserting, removing, and querying headers from the store. The module is used in the larger project to cache block headers and improve synchronization efficiency.

The `HeaderMap` struct contains an `inner` field which is an `Arc` (atomic reference count) to a `HeaderMapKernel` instance. The `HeaderMapKernel` is a generic struct that takes a backend implementation as a type parameter. In this case, the backend is `SledBackend`, which is a key-value store implementation based on the Sled embedded database.

The `HeaderMap` struct also contains a `stop` field which is a `StopHandler` instance. The `StopHandler` is used to gracefully shut down the background task that limits the memory usage of the key-value store.

The `HeaderMap` module provides methods for inserting, removing, and querying headers from the store. The `contains_key` method checks if a header with the given hash exists in the store. The `get` method returns the header with the given hash if it exists in the store. The `insert` method inserts a header into the store. The `remove` method removes a header with the given hash from the store.

The `HeaderMap` module also provides a constructor method `new` that creates a new `HeaderMap` instance. The `new` method takes three parameters: `tmpdir`, `memory_limit`, and `async_handle`. The `tmpdir` parameter is an optional temporary directory path used by the backend to store data. The `memory_limit` parameter specifies the maximum amount of memory that the key-value store can use. The `async_handle` parameter is a handle to the asynchronous runtime used to spawn the background task that limits the memory usage of the key-value store.

The `new` method creates a new `HeaderMapKernel` instance with the `SledBackend` backend and the specified `tmpdir` and `memory_limit` parameters. It then creates a new `Arc` to the `HeaderMapKernel` instance and sets it as the `inner` field of the `HeaderMap` struct. It also spawns a background task that limits the memory usage of the key-value store by periodically calling the `limit_memory` method of the `HeaderMapKernel` instance. The background task is stopped when the `stop` method of the `StopHandler` instance is called.

The `HeaderMap` module is used in the larger project to cache block headers and improve synchronization efficiency. By caching block headers in memory, the project can avoid reading headers from disk repeatedly, which can be slow and inefficient. The `HeaderMap` module provides a simple and efficient way to cache block headers and query them by hash.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HeaderMap` struct and how is it used?
- The `HeaderMap` struct is used to store and manage header data for the CKB blockchain. It provides methods for inserting, getting, and removing header data, as well as checking if a given header hash is contained in the map.

2. What is the significance of the `ITEM_BYTES_SIZE` constant and how is it used?
- The `ITEM_BYTES_SIZE` constant represents the size of each header item in bytes, including the header data itself, the total difficulty, and the skip hash. It is used to calculate the memory limit and warn threshold for the `HeaderMap`, and to limit the amount of memory used by the map.

3. What is the purpose of the `async_handle` parameter in the `new` method, and how is it used?
- The `async_handle` parameter is used to spawn an asynchronous task that periodically limits the memory usage of the `HeaderMap`. It is passed to the `new` method to ensure that the task is spawned on the same runtime as the rest of the CKB application.
