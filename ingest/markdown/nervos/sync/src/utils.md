The code provided is a Rust module that contains several utility functions for sending network messages in the CKB (Nervos Common Knowledge Base) project. The module is part of the CKB networking library and is used to send messages between nodes in the CKB network.

The `send_message` function is used to send a message of type `Message` to a peer with the given `peer_index` over the protocol with the given `protocol_id`. The function returns a `Status` object that indicates whether the message was sent successfully or not. If there was an error sending the message, the function logs an error message and returns a `StatusCode` object with an error context.

The `send_message_to` function is a convenience function that sends a message to a peer over the protocol that the `CKBProtocolContext` object is currently using. It calls the `send_message` function with the appropriate protocol ID.

The `message_name` and `item_name` functions are used to extract the name of the message and the name of the item from the message, respectively. These functions are used to log metrics about the size of messages being sent over the network.

The `protocol_name` function returns the name of the protocol associated with the given protocol ID. This function is used to log metrics about the size of messages being sent over the network.

The `is_internal_db_error` function is a utility function that checks whether a given error is an internal database error. If the error is an internal database error, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. This function is used to handle errors that occur when interacting with the CKB database.

Overall, this module provides several utility functions that are used to send messages over the CKB network and log metrics about the size of those messages. These functions are used throughout the CKB networking library to facilitate communication between nodes in the CKB network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `send_message` and `send_message_to` functions?
- The `send_message` function sends a network message into a specified protocol connection, while the `send_message_to` function sends a network message into the current protocol connection.
2. What is the purpose of the `metric_ckb_message_bytes` function?
- The `metric_ckb_message_bytes` function is used to record the number of bytes sent or received for a given CKB message.
3. What is the purpose of the `is_internal_db_error` function?
- The `is_internal_db_error` function checks whether a given error is related to an internal database error, and returns a boolean value indicating the result.
