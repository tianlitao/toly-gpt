The `GetBlockTransactionsProcess` struct and its associated implementation define a process for handling a `GetBlockTransactions` message received by a node in the CKB (Nervos Common Knowledge Base) blockchain network. 

The `GetBlockTransactions` message is used to request a set of transactions and uncles (i.e. blocks that are not direct ancestors of the current block) from a specific block identified by its hash. The message contains a list of indexes that correspond to the transactions and uncles to be retrieved. 

The `execute` method of the `GetBlockTransactionsProcess` struct is called to handle the message. It first checks that the number of indexes and uncle indexes in the message are within the expected limits. If the message is malformed, an error status is returned. 

If the message is valid, the block hash is extracted from the message and used to retrieve the corresponding block from the node's store. The transactions and uncles specified in the message are then extracted from the block using their respective indexes. 

A new `BlockTransactions` message is constructed using the extracted transactions and uncles, and sent back to the requesting peer using the `send_message_to` utility function. 

Overall, this code provides a way for nodes in the CKB network to request and retrieve specific transactions and uncles from a block, and to respond to such requests from other nodes. It is part of the larger CKB project, which aims to provide a secure, decentralized, and scalable blockchain platform for building decentralized applications.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   
   This code defines a struct `GetBlockTransactionsProcess` and implements a method `execute` for it. The method takes a `packed::GetBlockTransactionsReader` message, filters transactions and uncles from a block, and sends them to a peer using the `send_message_to` function.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
   
   This code depends on several external crates: `ckb_logger`, `ckb_network`, `ckb_store`, and `ckb_types`. It also uses the `std::sync::Arc` type.

3. What is the purpose of the `MAX_RELAY_TXS_NUM_PER_BATCH` constant and how is it used?
   
   The `MAX_RELAY_TXS_NUM_PER_BATCH` constant is used to limit the number of transactions that can be relayed to a peer in a single batch. It is checked against the number of indexes in the `GetBlockTransactionsReader` message, and if the count exceeds the limit, a `StatusCode::ProtocolMessageIsMalformed` error is returned.
