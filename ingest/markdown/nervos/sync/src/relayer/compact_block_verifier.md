The code defines three structs: `CompactBlockVerifier`, `PrefilledVerifier`, and `ShortIdsVerifier`. These structs are used to verify the validity of a `CompactBlock` object, which is a compressed representation of a block in the CKB blockchain.

The `CompactBlockVerifier` struct has a single method, `verify`, which takes a `CompactBlock` object as input and returns a `Status` object. This method calls the `verify` methods of the `PrefilledVerifier` and `ShortIdsVerifier` structs and returns `Status::ok()` if both verifications pass.

The `PrefilledVerifier` struct has a single method, `verify`, which takes a `CompactBlock` object as input and returns a `Status` object. This method checks that the `prefilled_transactions` field of the `CompactBlock` object is valid. Specifically, it checks that the `prefilled_transactions` field includes the cellbase transaction, that the first prefilled index is zero, that the highest prefilled index is less than the length of the block transactions, and that the indices of the prefilled transactions are in order.

The `ShortIdsVerifier` struct also has a single method, `verify`, which takes a `CompactBlock` object as input and returns a `Status` object. This method checks that the `short_ids` field of the `CompactBlock` object is valid. Specifically, it checks that there are no duplicated short ids, and that there is no intersection between the `prefilled_transactions` and `short_ids` fields, except for the cellbase transaction.

Overall, these structs are used to ensure that a `CompactBlock` object is valid before it is added to the CKB blockchain. This helps to maintain the integrity of the blockchain and prevent invalid blocks from being added. An example usage of these structs might look like:

```
let block = packed::CompactBlock::new_builder().build();
let status = CompactBlockVerifier::verify(&block);
if status.is_ok() {
    // add block to blockchain
} else {
    // handle error
}
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompactBlockVerifier` struct?
- The `CompactBlockVerifier` struct is used to verify the validity of a compact block.

2. What does the `PrefilledVerifier` struct check for?
- The `PrefilledVerifier` struct checks that prefilled transactions in a compact block are valid, including checking that the cellbase is included and that the indices of prefilled transactions are in order.

3. What does the `ShortIdsVerifier` struct check for?
- The `ShortIdsVerifier` struct checks that the short IDs in a compact block are valid, including checking for duplicates and checking for intersection with prefilled transactions (excluding the cellbase).
