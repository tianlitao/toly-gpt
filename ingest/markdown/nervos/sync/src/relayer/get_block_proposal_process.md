The `GetBlockProposalProcess` struct and its associated implementation define a process for handling a request for block proposals from a peer node in the CKB (Nervos Common Knowledge Base) blockchain network.

The `execute` method is the main entry point for this process. It takes in a `GetBlockProposalReader` message, which contains a list of `ProposalShortId`s that the peer is requesting block proposals for. The method first checks if the number of proposals in the message exceeds the maximum limit set by the consensus rules. If it does, the method returns an error status. Otherwise, it proceeds to fetch the transactions corresponding to the requested proposals from the transaction pool. If any of the requested transactions are not found in the pool, they are added to a cache for later processing.

The method then iterates over the fetched transactions, adding them to a list of proposals to be relayed to the requesting peer. The proposals are added to this list until the maximum size limit for a batch of relayed transactions is reached, at which point the list is sent to the peer and a new list is started. If there are any remaining proposals in the list after all transactions have been processed, they are also sent to the peer.

The `send_block_proposals` method is a helper function that takes in a list of `Transaction`s and constructs a `BlockProposal` message containing them. This message is then sent to the requesting peer using the `send_message_to` function.

Overall, this process is responsible for handling requests for block proposals from peer nodes and relaying the corresponding transactions to them. It ensures that the number and size of the relayed transactions are within the limits set by the consensus rules, and caches any missing transactions for later processing.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall ckb project?
- This code is a process for handling GetBlockProposal messages received from peers in the CKB network. It is part of the relayer module which is responsible for relaying transactions and blocks between nodes in the network.

2. What is the significance of the `limit` variable and how is it calculated?
- The `limit` variable is used to calculate the maximum number of uncles that can be included in a block proposal request. It is calculated by multiplying the maximum number of block proposals allowed by the consensus rules with the maximum number of uncles allowed by the consensus rules.

3. What happens if a transaction requested by a peer does not exist on the current node?
- If a transaction requested by a peer does not exist on the current node, its proposal short ID is added to a list of not exist proposals. This list is then cached and processed on a timer.
