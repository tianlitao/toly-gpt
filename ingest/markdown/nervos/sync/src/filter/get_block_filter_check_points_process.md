The `GetBlockFilterCheckPointsProcess` struct and its associated implementation provide functionality for processing a request for block filter checkpoints from a peer node in the CKB (Nervos) blockchain network. 

The `execute` method is the main entry point for this functionality. It takes in a `packed::GetBlockFilterCheckPointsReader` message, a `BlockFilter` instance, a `CKBProtocolContext` instance, and a `PeerIndex` value. It returns a `Status` value indicating whether the execution was successful or not.

The method first retrieves the active chain from the `BlockFilter` instance. It then extracts the start block number from the input message and the tip block number from the active chain. If the tip block number is greater than or equal to the start block number, the method proceeds to retrieve block filter hashes for a range of blocks, starting from the start block number and incrementing by `BATCH_SIZE * CHECK_POINT_INTERVAL` for each iteration. The `BATCH_SIZE` and `CHECK_POINT_INTERVAL` constants are set to 2000 in this implementation.

For each block in the range, the method attempts to retrieve the block filter hash from the active chain. If successful, the hash is added to a vector of block filter hashes. If unsuccessful, the loop is broken. Once all block filter hashes have been retrieved, a `BlockFilterCheckPoints` message is constructed using the start block number and the vector of block filter hashes. This message is then wrapped in a `BlockFilterMessage` and sent to the peer node using the `send_message_to` function from the `utils` module.

Overall, this code provides a way for a peer node to request block filter checkpoints from another node in the CKB network. The checkpoints can be used to verify the validity of block filters for a range of blocks, which can help improve the security and efficiency of the network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GetBlockFilterCheckPointsProcess` struct and its `execute` method?
- The `GetBlockFilterCheckPointsProcess` struct is used to handle incoming `GetBlockFilterCheckPoints` messages and respond with a list of block filter hashes. The `execute` method retrieves the requested block filter hashes and sends them back to the requesting peer.
    
2. What is the significance of the `BATCH_SIZE` and `CHECK_POINT_INTERVAL` constants?
- `BATCH_SIZE` and `CHECK_POINT_INTERVAL` are used to determine the range of block numbers for which block filter hashes will be retrieved. Specifically, block filter hashes will be retrieved for blocks with numbers in the range `[start_number, start_number + BATCH_SIZE * CHECK_POINT_INTERVAL)`.

3. What is the purpose of the `send_message_to` function and where is it defined?
- The `send_message_to` function is used to send a message to a specific peer over the CKB network. It is defined in the `utils` module, which is imported at the top of the file.
