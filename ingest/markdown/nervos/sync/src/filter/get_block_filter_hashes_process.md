The `GetBlockFilterHashesProcess` struct and its associated implementation provide functionality for processing a request for block filter hashes from a peer node in the CKB (Nervos) blockchain network.

The `execute` method is the main entry point for this functionality. It takes in a `packed::GetBlockFilterHashesReader` message, a `BlockFilter` instance, a `CKBProtocolContext` instance, and a `PeerIndex` value. It returns a `Status` value indicating whether the request was successfully processed or ignored.

The method first retrieves the active chain from the `BlockFilter` instance. It then extracts the starting block number from the input message and the tip block number from the active chain. If the tip block number is greater than or equal to the starting block number, the method proceeds to retrieve the block filter hashes for the specified range of blocks.

For each block in the range, the method attempts to retrieve the block filter hash from the active chain. If successful, the hash is added to a vector of block filter hashes. If unsuccessful, the method breaks out of the loop.

Once all block filter hashes have been retrieved, the method constructs a new `packed::BlockFilterHashes` message containing the start block number, parent block filter hash, and block filter hashes vector. This message is then wrapped in a `packed::BlockFilterMessage` and sent to the requesting peer node using the `send_message_to` utility function.

If the tip block number is less than the starting block number, the method returns a `Status::ignored()` value, indicating that the request was not processed.

Overall, this code provides a way for peer nodes in the CKB network to request block filter hashes for a specified range of blocks. This functionality is important for enabling efficient transaction filtering and validation in the network.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a process for handling a `GetBlockFilterHashes` message, which retrieves block filter hashes for a range of block numbers.
2. What is the significance of the `BATCH_SIZE` constant?
   - The `BATCH_SIZE` constant determines the maximum number of block filter hashes that can be retrieved in a single `GetBlockFilterHashes` message.
3. What is the expected return value of the `execute` function?
   - The `execute` function returns a `Status` enum, which indicates whether the message was successfully sent or ignored.
