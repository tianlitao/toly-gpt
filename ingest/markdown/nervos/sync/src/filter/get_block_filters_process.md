The `GetBlockFiltersProcess` struct and its associated implementation provide functionality for processing a request for block filters from a peer node in the CKB (Nervos Common Knowledge Base) project. 

The `execute` method is the main entry point for this functionality. It takes in a `packed::GetBlockFiltersReader` message, a `BlockFilter`, a `CKBProtocolContext` and a `PeerIndex`. The `GetBlockFiltersProcess` struct is initialized with these parameters using the `new` method. 

The `execute` method first retrieves the active chain from the `BlockFilter` and the start and tip block numbers from the `GetBlockFiltersReader` message. If the tip block number is greater than or equal to the start block number, the method retrieves block hashes and filters for a batch of blocks, up to a maximum batch size of 1000 blocks. If a block hash or filter is not found, the method breaks out of the loop. 

The method then constructs a `packed::BlockFilters` message containing the block hashes and filters, and sends it to the requesting peer using the `send_message_to` method. 

Overall, this code provides a way for a peer node to request block filters from the active chain in the CKB project. The `GetBlockFiltersProcess` struct encapsulates the logic for processing this request, and the `execute` method is the main entry point for this functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a struct called `GetBlockFiltersProcess` which has a method called `execute`. The method retrieves block filters for a range of block numbers and sends them to a peer over the CKB network.
2. What is the significance of the `BATCH_SIZE` constant?
   - The `BATCH_SIZE` constant determines the number of block filters that are retrieved and sent to the peer at a time. In this case, it is set to 1000.
3. What is the `attempt!` macro used for in this code?
   - The `attempt!` macro is used to handle errors that may occur when sending a message to a peer over the CKB network. If an error occurs, the macro will return the error as a `Status` enum value.
