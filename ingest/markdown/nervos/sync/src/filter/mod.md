The `BlockFilter` module is a protocol handler for the CKB (Nervos Network) blockchain. It is responsible for handling messages related to block filters, which are used to allow light clients to verify the inclusion of transactions in blocks without downloading the entire blockchain.

The `BlockFilter` struct contains a reference to the shared state of the synchronization process. It has a `new` method that creates a new instance of the struct.

The `BlockFilter` struct implements the `CKBProtocolHandler` trait, which defines methods for handling incoming messages, initializing the protocol, and handling connection events.

The `BlockFilter` struct has a private method called `try_process` that takes a reference to the protocol context, a peer index, and a `BlockFilterMessageUnionReader` message. This method is responsible for processing the incoming message and returning a `Status` object that indicates whether the message was processed successfully, should be ignored, or should result in the banning of the peer that sent it.

The `BlockFilter` struct also has a private method called `process` that takes the same arguments as `try_process` but also logs metrics related to the incoming message and its processing.

The `BlockFilter` struct implements the `CKBProtocolHandler` trait's `received` method, which is called when a message is received from a peer. This method parses the incoming message and calls the `process` method to handle it.

The `BlockFilter` struct also implements the `CKBProtocolHandler` trait's `connected` and `disconnected` methods, which are called when a peer connects or disconnects from the node.

Overall, the `BlockFilter` module is an important part of the CKB blockchain's synchronization process, allowing light clients to verify the inclusion of transactions in blocks without downloading the entire blockchain.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of the BlockFilter protocol handler, which handles messages related to block filters.

2. What other modules or crates does this code file depend on?
- This code file depends on several other modules and crates, including `get_block_filter_check_points_process`, `get_block_filter_hashes_process`, `get_block_filters_process`, `types::SyncShared`, `utils`, `ckb_constant`, `ckb_logger`, and `ckb_network`.

3. What is the role of the `try_process` and `process` functions in this code file?
- The `try_process` function attempts to process a received message and returns a `Status` indicating whether the processing was successful or not. The `process` function calls `try_process` and logs the result, and also bans the peer if necessary.
