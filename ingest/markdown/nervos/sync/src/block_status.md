This code defines a set of bitflags for the `BlockStatus` struct. Bitflags are a way of representing a set of boolean flags as a single integer value, where each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific flag. This allows for efficient storage and manipulation of sets of flags.

The `BlockStatus` struct represents the status of a block in the blockchain. It has several possible states, each represented by a different combination of flags. The flags are defined using the `bitflags!` macro from the `bitflags` crate.

The `BlockStatus` struct has five possible states:

- `UNKNOWN`: The initial state of a block, before any information has been received about it.
- `HEADER_VALID`: The block header has been received and validated.
- `BLOCK_RECEIVED`: The full block has been received.
- `BLOCK_STORED`: The full block has been stored in the local database.
- `BLOCK_VALID`: The block has been fully validated and is considered valid.

The `BlockStatus` struct also has one additional flag, `BLOCK_INVALID`, which is used to indicate that the block is invalid.

Each flag is represented by a bit in the integer value of the `BlockStatus` struct. For example, `HEADER_VALID` is represented by the bit with value `1`, `BLOCK_RECEIVED` is represented by the bit with value `2`, and so on. The `bits` method is used to get the integer value of a set of flags.

This code can be used in the larger project to represent the status of blocks in the blockchain. For example, when a new block is received, its status can be set to `HEADER_VALID`. As more information is received and validated, the status can be updated to reflect the current state of the block. This allows other parts of the system to easily check the status of a block and take appropriate action based on its current state.

Example usage:

```
let mut block_status = BlockStatus::UNKNOWN;
block_status |= BlockStatus::HEADER_VALID;
if block_received {
    block_status |= BlockStatus::BLOCK_RECEIVED;
}
if block_stored {
    block_status |= BlockStatus::BLOCK_STORED;
}
if block_valid {
    block_status |= BlockStatus::BLOCK_VALID;
}
if block_invalid {
    block_status |= BlockStatus::BLOCK_INVALID;
}
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `bitflags` crate and how is it used in this code?
   - The `bitflags` crate is used to create bitflags for a struct, allowing for easy manipulation of binary flags. It is used in this code to define the `BlockStatus` struct with various flag constants.
2. What do the different flag constants in the `BlockStatus` struct represent?
   - The `BlockStatus` struct defines several flag constants that represent different states of a block. These include `UNKNOWN`, `HEADER_VALID`, `BLOCK_RECEIVED`, `BLOCK_STORED`, `BLOCK_VALID`, and `BLOCK_INVALID`.
3. How are the flag constants combined to represent different block states?
   - The `BlockStatus` struct uses bitwise operations to combine the flag constants and represent different block states. For example, `BLOCK_RECEIVED` is defined as `HEADER_VALID.bits | 1 << 1`, meaning it includes the `HEADER_VALID` flag and the second bit. Similarly, `BLOCK_STORED` includes the `HEADER_VALID`, `BLOCK_RECEIVED`, and fourth bit flags.
