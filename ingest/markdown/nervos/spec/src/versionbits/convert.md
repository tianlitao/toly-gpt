This code provides implementations for three conversion functions: `From<ThresholdState> for DeploymentState>`, `From<Deployment> for DeploymentInfo>`, and `From<DeploymentPos> for JsonDeploymentPos>`. These functions are used to convert between different types related to the deployment of consensus rule changes in the CKB (Nervos Common Knowledge Base) blockchain.

The `From<ThresholdState> for DeploymentState>` function takes a `ThresholdState` enum value and returns a corresponding `DeploymentState` enum value. The `ThresholdState` enum represents the state of a consensus rule change deployment, while the `DeploymentState` enum represents the state of a deployment in the JSON-RPC API. This conversion function is used to convert the internal representation of a deployment state to the representation used in the API.

The `From<Deployment> for DeploymentInfo>` function takes a `Deployment` struct and returns a corresponding `DeploymentInfo` struct. The `Deployment` struct represents a consensus rule change deployment, while the `DeploymentInfo` struct represents information about a deployment in the JSON-RPC API. This conversion function is used to convert the internal representation of a deployment to the representation used in the API.

The `From<DeploymentPos> for JsonDeploymentPos>` function takes a `DeploymentPos` enum value and returns a corresponding `JsonDeploymentPos` enum value. The `DeploymentPos` enum represents the position of a consensus rule change deployment in the deployment process, while the `JsonDeploymentPos` enum represents the position of a deployment in the JSON-RPC API. This conversion function is used to convert the internal representation of a deployment position to the representation used in the API.

Overall, these conversion functions are important for ensuring that the internal representation of consensus rule change deployments in the CKB blockchain can be properly communicated to external clients through the JSON-RPC API. For example, a client may use the `get_blockchain_info` API method to retrieve information about the current state of the blockchain, including information about consensus rule change deployments. The `From<Deployment>` and `From<DeploymentPos>` conversion functions are used to convert the internal representation of these deployments to the representation used in the API response.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `versionbits` module that is being imported?
   - The `versionbits` module is being used to define the `ThresholdState`, `Deployment`, and `DeploymentPos` types that are used in this code.
2. What is the relationship between the `Deployment` and `DeploymentInfo` types?
   - The `From` trait is implemented for `Deployment` to convert it into a `DeploymentInfo` struct, which is used to represent deployment information in the JSON-RPC API.
3. What is the significance of the `JsonDeploymentPos` type and how is it related to `DeploymentPos`?
   - The `JsonDeploymentPos` type is used to represent deployment positions in the JSON-RPC API, and the `From` trait is implemented for `DeploymentPos` to convert it into a `JsonDeploymentPos`.
