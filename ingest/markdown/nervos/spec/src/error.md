This code defines an error type for Spec operations in the ckb project. The SpecError enum contains three variants: FileNotFound, ChainNameNotAllowed, and GenesisMismatch. Each variant represents a specific error that can occur during Spec operations.

The FileNotFound variant is used when a file cannot be found. The ChainNameNotAllowed variant is used when a reserved chain name is specified. The GenesisMismatch variant is used when the actual calculated genesis hash does not match the provided expected hash. This variant contains two fields: expected and actual, which are both of type Byte32.

The code also implements the From trait for the SpecError enum, which allows SpecError to be converted into an Error from the ckb_error crate. This is useful for handling errors in the larger ckb project, as it allows SpecError to be treated as a standard error type.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger ckb project:

```rust
use ckb_error::Error;
use ckb_spec::SpecError;

fn do_spec_operation() -> Result<(), Error> {
    // perform Spec operation
    // if an error occurs, return a SpecError
    Err(SpecError::FileNotFound("file.txt".to_string()).into())
}
```

In this example, a function called do_spec_operation performs a Spec operation. If an error occurs, it returns a SpecError using the FileNotFound variant. The error is then converted into an Error using the From implementation, which allows it to be handled by the ckb_error crate.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the ckb project?
   This code defines an error type for Spec operations in the ckb project. It can be used to handle errors related to file not found, chain name not allowed, and genesis hash mismatch.

2. What is the relationship between `SpecError` and `Error`?
   `SpecError` is converted to `Error` using the `From` trait implementation. This allows `SpecError` to be used as a cause for `Error` with the `because` method.

3. What information is included in the `GenesisMismatch` variant of `SpecError`?
   The `GenesisMismatch` variant includes two fields: `expected` and `actual`, which represent the expected and actual calculated genesis hash, respectively.
