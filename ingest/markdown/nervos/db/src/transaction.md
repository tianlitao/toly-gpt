The `RocksDBTransaction` module provides an optimistic transaction wrapper for RocksDB. It is used to perform read and write operations on a RocksDB database with transactional semantics. The module provides a set of methods to read, write, and delete data from the database, as well as to commit or rollback transactions.

The `RocksDBTransaction` struct represents a transaction on a RocksDB database. It contains a reference to the underlying `OptimisticTransactionDB` and an `OptimisticTransaction` object that represents the transaction itself. The `RocksDBTransaction` struct provides methods to read, write, and delete data from the database, as well as to commit or rollback transactions.

The `RocksDBTransactionSnapshot` struct represents a snapshot of a transaction at a particular point in time. It is used to read data from the database without affecting the transaction itself. The `RocksDBTransactionSnapshot` struct contains a reference to the underlying `OptimisticTransactionDB` and an `OptimisticTransactionSnapshot` object that represents the snapshot itself. The `RocksDBTransactionSnapshot` struct provides a method to read data from the database.

The `RocksDBTransaction` module can be used to perform transactional operations on a RocksDB database. For example, the following code creates a transaction, writes a key-value pair to the database, and commits the transaction:

```rust
use ckb_db::RocksDBTransaction;
use ckb_db_schema::Col;

let db = ...; // create a RocksDB database
let tx = RocksDBTransaction::new(&db); // create a transaction
let col = Col::Block; // specify the column family
let key = b"key"; // specify the key
let value = b"value"; // specify the value
tx.put(col, key, value)?; // write the key-value pair to the database
tx.commit()?; // commit the transaction
```

The `RocksDBTransaction` module can also be used to read data from the database. For example, the following code creates a transaction, reads a key-value pair from the database, and rolls back the transaction:

```rust
use ckb_db::RocksDBTransaction;
use ckb_db_schema::Col;

let db = ...; // create a RocksDB database
let tx = RocksDBTransaction::new(&db); // create a transaction
let col = Col::Block; // specify the column family
let key = b"key"; // specify the key
let value = tx.get_pinned(col, key)?; // read the key-value pair from the database
tx.rollback()?; // rollback the transaction
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code provides an optimistic transaction wrapper for RocksDB, which allows for atomicity and consistency in database operations even in the presence of concurrent transactions.

2. What are the main methods provided by the `RocksDBTransaction` struct and what do they do?
- The `RocksDBTransaction` struct provides methods for getting, putting, and deleting data associated with a given key and column, as well as for reading a key and making the read value a precondition for transaction commit. It also provides methods for committing or rolling back the transaction, setting a savepoint, and rolling back to a savepoint.

3. What is the purpose of the `RocksDBTransactionSnapshot` struct and how does it relate to the `RocksDBTransaction` struct?
- The `RocksDBTransactionSnapshot` struct captures a point-in-time view of the transaction at the time it's created, allowing for consistent reads even in the presence of concurrent transactions. It is created using the `get_snapshot` method of the `RocksDBTransaction` struct.
