The code is a benchmarking tool for the `ckb` project. Specifically, it benchmarks the processing of blocks in the `secp` module of the project. The benchmarking is done using the `criterion` library.

The code defines three benchmarks, each with a different scenario for processing blocks. The first benchmark processes 20 blocks on the main branch. The second benchmark processes 2 blocks on a side branch, and the third benchmark processes 4 blocks for switching forks.

Each benchmark iterates over a set of block sizes defined in the `SIZES` constant. For each block size, the benchmark creates a new chain and shared data structure using the `new_secp_chain` function from the `util` module. The chain is then used to process the blocks according to the scenario of the benchmark.

The benchmarking is done using the `iter_batched` function from `criterion`. This function takes two closures as arguments: one for setting up the benchmark and one for running the benchmark. The `BatchSize` parameter specifies how many iterations to run per batch.

The benchmark results are grouped by scenario and block size using the `benchmark_group` function from `criterion`. The results are then printed to the console.

Overall, this code provides a way to measure the performance of block processing in the `secp` module of the `ckb` project. The benchmarks can be used to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code for better performance.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `process_block` function being benchmarked?
- The `process_block` function is being benchmarked to measure the performance of processing blocks on different branches of the blockchain.

2. What is the significance of the `SIZES` constant and how is it used in the code?
- The `SIZES` constant is used to define the size of the transactions to be processed in the benchmarks. It is used to iterate over the different transaction sizes and run the benchmarks for each size.

3. What is the role of the `Switch` trait in the code?
- The `Switch` trait is used to enable or disable certain verification checks during block processing. It is used to disable all checks during the benchmarking process to measure the raw performance of block processing.
