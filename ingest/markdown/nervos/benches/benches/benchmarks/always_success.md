The code is a benchmarking tool for processing blocks in the ckb project. The `bench` function uses the `criterion` crate to run benchmarks on three different scenarios: processing 20 blocks on the main branch, processing 2 blocks on a side branch, and switching forks by processing 4 blocks.

For each scenario, the function creates a benchmark group and iterates over a list of sizes. For each size, it creates a benchmark with an input size of `txs_size`. The benchmark function takes two arguments: a mutable reference to the benchmark runner (`b`) and the input size (`i`).

The benchmark function first generates a chain of blocks using the `new_always_success_chain` function from the `ckb_store` crate. It then processes the blocks using the `internal_process_block` and `process_block` functions from the `ckb_verification_traits` crate. The `internal_process_block` function is used to process blocks on the side chain, while the `process_block` function is used to process blocks on the main chain.

The `gen_always_success_block` function generates a new block with the always-success script. The function takes a mutable reference to a vector of blocks and the parent block as arguments. It generates a new block with a random transaction and adds it to the vector of blocks. It then sets the new block's parent to the parent block and returns the new block.

The `new_always_success_chain` function generates a new chain of blocks with the always-success script. The function takes two arguments: the number of blocks to generate and the number of forks to create. It returns a tuple containing a vector of chains and a shared chain. The vector of chains contains the main chain and the side chains, while the shared chain is used to share data between the chains.

The `process_block` function processes a block on the main chain. It takes an `Arc` reference to the block as an argument and returns a `Result` indicating whether the block was processed successfully.

The `internal_process_block` function processes a block on a side chain. It takes an `Arc` reference to the block and a `Switch` value as arguments. The `Switch` value is used to enable or disable certain features during block processing. The function returns a `Result` indicating whether the block was processed successfully.

The `BatchSize::PerIteration` argument passed to the `iter_batched` function specifies the number of iterations to run per batch.

The `criterion_group` macro creates a new benchmark group with the name `process_block`. It also sets the sample size to 10 and specifies the `bench` function as the target.
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `process_block` function being benchmarked?
- The `process_block` function is being benchmarked to measure the performance of processing blocks on different branches of the blockchain.

2. What is the significance of the `SIZES` constant and how is it used in the code?
- The `SIZES` constant is used to define the sizes of the blocks being processed in the benchmarks. It is used to iterate over the different block sizes and run the benchmarks for each size.

3. What is the role of the `Switch` trait in this code?
- The `Switch` trait is used to enable or disable certain features during block processing. It is used to disable all features during benchmarking to ensure accurate performance measurements.
