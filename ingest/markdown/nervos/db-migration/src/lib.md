The `migrations` module in the `ckb` project provides a way to manage database schema migrations. The `Migrations` struct is the main entry point for managing migrations. It contains a collection of `Migration` objects, which are responsible for performing the actual database schema changes.

The `Migrations` struct provides several methods for managing migrations. The `check` method is used to determine if the database schema is up-to-date with the current version of the executable binary. The method returns an `Ordering` value, which can be used to determine if the schema needs to be migrated or upgraded. The `expensive` method is used to determine if any of the migrations are expensive, meaning they will take a long time to complete. The `migrate` method is used to perform the actual schema migration.

The `Migration` trait defines the interface for performing schema migrations. It contains three methods: `migrate`, `version`, and `expensive`. The `migrate` method is responsible for performing the actual schema migration. The `version` method returns the version of the migration. The `expensive` method is used to determine if the migration is expensive.

The `DefaultMigration` struct is a simple implementation of the `Migration` trait. It does not perform any schema changes and is not expensive. It is used as a placeholder when no other migrations are defined.

Overall, the `migrations` module provides a flexible and extensible way to manage database schema migrations in the `ckb` project. Developers can define their own migrations by implementing the `Migration` trait and adding them to the `Migrations` struct. The `Migrations` struct provides a simple and consistent interface for managing migrations, making it easy to keep the database schema up-to-date with the latest version of the executable binary.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Migrations` struct and its methods?
- The `Migrations` struct is responsible for managing database migrations. Its methods include adding a migration, checking if the database version matches the executable binary version, and running migrations.

2. What is the purpose of the `Migration` trait and its methods?
- The `Migration` trait defines the interface for a database migration. Its methods include migrating the database, returning the migration version, and indicating whether the migration is expensive.

3. What is the purpose of the `DefaultMigration` struct and its methods?
- The `DefaultMigration` struct is a default implementation of the `Migration` trait that does not perform any migration. Its purpose is to provide a default version for the database.
