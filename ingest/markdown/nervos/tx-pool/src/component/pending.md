The `PendingQueue` struct is a data structure used to manage transactions that are currently in the transaction pool of the CKB (Nervos Common Knowledge Base) blockchain. It contains several maps that store information about the transactions, such as their inputs, outputs, and dependencies.

The `PendingQueue` struct has several methods that allow transactions to be added, removed, and queried. When a new transaction is added to the pool, the `add_entry` method is called. This method takes a `TxEntry` object, which contains information about the transaction, such as its proposal short ID and related dependencies. The method then updates the various maps in the `PendingQueue` struct to reflect the new transaction.

The `resolve_conflict` method is used to resolve conflicts between transactions in the pool. When a conflict arises, such as when two transactions have conflicting inputs, this method is called to remove the conflicting transactions from the pool. The `resolve_conflict_header_dep` method is similar, but is used to resolve conflicts between transactions that have conflicting header dependencies.

The `remove_entry` and `remove_entry_and_descendants` methods are used to remove transactions from the pool. The former removes a single transaction, while the latter removes a transaction and all of its descendants (i.e. transactions that depend on it).

The `fill_proposals` method is used to fill a set of proposal transactions. This is used when a new block is being created, and the miner needs to select a set of transactions to include in the block. The method takes a limit parameter, which specifies the maximum number of transactions to include, and an exclusion set, which contains transactions that should not be included. The method then fills the proposals set with transactions from the pool, up to the limit.

Finally, the `CellProvider` and `CellChecker` traits are implemented for the `PendingQueue` struct. These traits are used to provide information about cells (i.e. transaction outputs) to other parts of the CKB codebase. The `cell` method of the `CellProvider` trait is used to retrieve information about a cell given its outpoint, while the `is_live` method of the `CellChecker` trait is used to check if a cell is still live (i.e. has not been spent).

Overall, the `PendingQueue` struct is an important part of the CKB transaction pool, and is used to manage transactions that are waiting to be included in a block. Its various methods and maps allow for efficient querying and manipulation of the transactions in the pool.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PendingQueue` struct?
- The `PendingQueue` struct represents a queue of transactions that are currently in the mempool waiting to be included in a block.

2. How does the `PendingQueue` handle conflicts between transactions?
- The `PendingQueue` has methods to resolve conflicts between transactions, including checking for conflicts with inputs and dependencies, and invalid header dependencies.

3. What traits does the `PendingQueue` implement and what are their purposes?
- The `PendingQueue` implements the `CellProvider` and `CellChecker` traits, which allow it to provide information about cells (unspent transaction outputs) to other parts of the system and check if a cell is live (i.e. unspent).
