This code is a module that contains various sub-modules and a public export of `TxEntry`. The purpose of this module is to provide functionality related to transaction processing in the larger project.

The `commit_txs_scanner` module likely contains code for scanning and committing transactions to the blockchain. The `entry` module likely contains code for representing and manipulating transaction entries. The `chunk`, `container`, `orphan`, `pending`, `proposed`, and `recent_reject` modules likely contain code for managing different types of transaction states and storage.

The `TxEntry` export is likely a struct or enum that represents a transaction entry in the blockchain. It may contain information such as the transaction hash, block number, and input/output data. This export can be used by other modules in the project that need to interact with transaction entries.

Overall, this module provides a foundation for transaction processing in the larger project. Other modules can use the functionality provided by this module to build more complex transaction processing logic.

Example usage of `TxEntry`:

```rust
use ckb::TxEntry;

let tx_entry = TxEntry::new(hash, block_number, input_data, output_data);
println!("Transaction hash: {}", tx_entry.hash());
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `commit_txs_scanner` module?
   - The `commit_txs_scanner` module is likely related to scanning and processing committed transactions in some way, but further investigation is needed to determine its exact purpose.
2. What is the difference between the modules marked as `pub(crate)` and those that are not?
   - Modules marked as `pub(crate)` are only accessible within the current crate, while those that are not marked can be accessed by external crates as well.
3. What is the significance of the `TxEntry` struct being made public through the `pub use` statement?
   - The `pub use` statement allows external crates to access the `TxEntry` struct without needing to import the `entry` module directly.
