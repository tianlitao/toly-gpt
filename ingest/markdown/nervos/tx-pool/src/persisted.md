This code defines two methods for the `TxPool` struct: `load_from_file` and `save_into_file`. These methods are used to persist the transaction pool data to a file and load it back from the file.

The `load_from_file` method reads the persisted data file and returns a vector of `TransactionView`s. It first constructs the file path by appending the version number to the file name, and then checks if the file exists. If the file exists, it opens the file and reads its contents into a buffer. It then uses the `TransactionVecReader` to parse the buffer into a `TransactionVec`, which is a packed representation of multiple transactions. Finally, it converts the `TransactionVec` into a vector of `TransactionView`s and returns it. If the file does not exist, it returns an empty vector.

The `save_into_file` method writes the current transaction pool data to the persisted data file. It first constructs the file path in the same way as `load_from_file`. It then opens the file in write mode, truncates it to zero length, and writes the current transaction pool data to the file using the `TransactionVec` builder. Finally, it syncs the file to disk to ensure that the data is persisted.

These methods are useful for persisting the transaction pool data across node restarts or crashes. By calling `load_from_file` during node startup, the node can restore the transaction pool data from the persisted data file. By calling `save_into_file` periodically or when the node is shutting down, the node can persist the current transaction pool data to the file.

Example usage:
```rust
let tx_pool = TxPool::new(config);
let txs = tx_pool.load_from_file().unwrap(); // Load persisted data from file
tx_pool.add_transactions(txs); // Add the loaded transactions to the transaction pool
// ... Node operation ...
tx_pool.save_into_file().unwrap(); // Persist the current transaction pool data to file
```
## Questions:
 1. What is the purpose of the `load_from_file` function?
- The `load_from_file` function is used to load persisted transaction data from a file into the transaction pool.

2. What is the purpose of the `save_into_file` function?
- The `save_into_file` function is used to save all transactions in the transaction pool into a file for persistence.

3. What is the significance of the `VERSION` constant?
- The `VERSION` constant represents the version of the persisted tx-pool data and is used to set the extension of the file name where the data is saved.
